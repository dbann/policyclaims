American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2021,Differences in Quitline Registrants’ Characteristics During National Radio Versus Television Antismoking Campaigns,"Introduction: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Tips From Former Smokers® campaign encourages smokers to get help with quitting smoking by promoting 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Campaign advertisements featuring an offer of help with obtaining free cessation medication aired nationally on radio for 2 weeks in 2016. Similar advertisements aired nationally on TV for 3 weeks in 2017. The comparison period of 2016 radio campaign and 2017 TV campaign was used to examine the characteristics of quitline registrants by a media referral source (TV or radio). Methods: Data on the number and demographics of quitline registrants in 2016 and 2017 were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Quitline Data Warehouse. The investigators conducted t-tests to assess the demographic differences between registrants who heard about the quitline through the radio advertisements and those who heard about it through the TV advertisements during the comparison period. This analysis was conducted in 2019. Results: The registrants who heard about the quitline from radio advertisements were more likely to be male, younger, and have more years of education. However, the registrants who heard about the quitline from TV advertisements were more likely to be Black, non-Hispanic, and have fewer years of education. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the demographic profiles of quitline registrants vary significantly based on how registrants hear about the quitline (via radio or TV). These differences in the characteristics of registrants can help inform the tobacco control mass media purchasing strategies and may enable media efforts to target the specific subgroups of smokers in a better way.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2020.08.006,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2024,Joint associations of sedentary behavior and domain-specific physical activity on C-reactive protein in Korea,"Sedentary behavior (SB) and physical activity (PA) exert opposing effects on inflammatory markers. This study examined the associations of a more subdivided combination of PA and SB with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Using the 2014–2019 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, this cross-sectional study analyzed 20,541 adults. The independent variables were SB, defined as ≥10 h of sitting per day, and three domains of PA: occupational PA (OPA) during work, leisure-time PA (LPA) during leisure time, and transportation PA (TPA) or active commuting. The dependent variable was hs-CRP ≥ 1.0 mg/L. Besides exploring the individual association of SB and each PA with hs-CRP, the combined association of SB and each PA with hs-CRP was also examined using multiple logistic regression. The analyses indicated that concurrent exposure to SB and OPA (odds ratio [OR] 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.80) significantly raised the likelihood of increased hs-CRP, while SB without LPA (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11–1.41) or TPA (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08–1.31) significantly increased risk of higher hs-CRP, compared to their respective reference. The absence of non-occupational PA such as LPA or TPA combined with SB was associated with the increased hs-CRP risk, whereas OPA increased the risk when present concurrently with SB. Reducing SB and OPA while increasing LPA and TPA, is necessary to reduce inflammatory conditions.","['C-reactive protein', 'Inflammatory marker', 'Occupational health practices', 'Physical activity', 'Sedentary behavior']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2024.107944,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2021,Severe Maternal Morbidity and Maternal Mortality in Women With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities,"Introduction: Despite increased attention on severe maternal morbidity and maternal mortality, scant research exists on adverse maternal outcomes in women with disabilities. This study compares the rates of severe maternal morbidity and maternal mortality in women with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities. Methods: This study used 2004–2017 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample data. Analyses were conducted in 2019‒2020. The risk of severe maternal morbidity with and without blood transfusion and maternal mortality during delivery among women with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities were compared using modified Poisson regression analysis. Results: This study identified 32,324 deliveries to women with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Per 10,000 deliveries, 566 deliveries with severe maternal morbidity occurred in women with intellectual and developmental disabilities compared with 239 in women without intellectual and developmental disabilities. Women with intellectual and developmental disabilities had greater risk of both severe maternal morbidity (risk ratio=2.36, 95% CI=2.06, 2.69) and nontransfusion severe maternal morbidity (risk ratio=2.95, 95% CI=2.42, 3.61) in unadjusted analyses, which was mitigated in adjusted analyses for sociodemographic characteristics (risk ratio=1.74, 95% CI=1.47, 2.06; risk ratio=1.85, 95% CI=1.42, 2.41) and the expanded obstetric comorbidity index (risk ratio=1.23, 95% CI=1.04, 1.44; risk ratio=1.31, 95% CI=1.02, 1.68). The unadjusted incidence of maternal mortality in women with intellectual and developmental disabilities was 284 per 100,000 deliveries, nearly 4-fold higher than in women without intellectual and developmental disabilities (69 per 100,000 deliveries; risk ratio=4.07, 95% CI=2.04, 8.12), and the risk remained almost 3-fold higher after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics (risk ratio=2.86, 95% CI=1.30, 6.29) and the expanded obstetric comorbidity index (risk ratio=2.30, 95% CI=1.05, 5.29). Conclusions: Women with intellectual and developmental disabilities are at increased risk of severe maternal morbidity and maternal mortality. These findings underscore the need for enhanced monitoring of the needs and maternal outcomes of women with intellectual and developmental disabilities in efforts to improve maternal health.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2021.05.041,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2021,Impact of cuts to local government spending on Sure Start children’s centres on childhood obesity in England: A longitudinal ecological study,"Childhood obesity is rising in disadvantaged areas in England. Sure Start children’s centres provide community-based services for children <5 years and their parents, including many services that can support healthy weight, directly or indirectly. Since 2010, austerity-driven cuts to local authority (LA) budgets have led to substantially reduced public expenditure on Sure Start services. We assessed whether childhood obesity prevalence has increased more since 2010 in those areas in England that experienced greater cuts to spending on Sure Start. This longitudinal ecological study covers the period 2010/2011–2017/2018. Our exposure was LA expenditure on Sure Start, using Department for Education data. Our main outcome was LA obesity prevalence at age 4–5 years, using National Child Measurement Programme data. We used fixed-effects panel regression to quantify the association between change in spending and change in the prevalence of childhood obesity. Spending on Sure Start children’s centres decreased on average 53% over the study period, with deeper cuts in more deprived LAs. Each 10% spending cut was associated with a 0.34% relative increase in obesity prevalence the following year (95% CI 0.15% to 0.53%). We estimated there were an additional 4575 children with obesity (95% CI 1751 to 7399) and 9174 overweight or obese (95% CI 2689 to 15 660) compared with expected numbers had funding levels been maintained. Cuts to spending on Sure Start children’s centres were associated with increased childhood obesity. With deprived areas experiencing bigger spending cuts, reinvesting in these services may, alongside wider benefits for child development, contribute to reducing inequalities in childhood obesity.","['child health', 'obesity', 'public health policy', 'social epidemiology']",10.1136/jech-2020-216064,1,True
American Journal Of Public Health,2022,"Structural Inequities, HIV Community-Based Organizations, and the End of the HIV Epidemic","Community-based organizations (CBOs) are integral to achieving the goal of Ending the HIV epidemic (EHE). Their familiarity with and proximity to communities position them to effectively implement strategies necessary to address determinants of health through their formal and informal medical and social services. However, structural inequities have contributed to the demise of many organizations that were instrumental in early responses to the HIV epidemic. We define structural inequities for HIV CBOs as systems in which policies, institutional practices, organizational (mis)representations, and other norms work to produce and maintain inequities that affect CBOs’ ability to survive and thrive. In this discussion, we describe the organizational threats to grassroots HIV CBOs and the risks to livelihood and longevity, including examples. The invaluable role of HIV CBOs in EHE and their role in responding to existing and novel infectious diseases like COVID-19 should not be overlooked. Recommendations to promote structural equity are offered.",[],10.2105/AJPH.2021.306688,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2021,Healthcare lobbying on upstream social determinants of health in the US,"Healthcare stakeholders are increasingly investing to address social determinants of health (SDOH) as they seek to improve health outcomes and reduce total healthcare costs in their communities. Policy heavily shapes SDOH, and healthcare lobbying on SDOH issues may offer large impacts through positive policy change. Federal lobbying disclosures from the ten highest spending health insurance and healthcare provider organizations and related associations between 2015 and 2019 were reviewed to identify lobbying reported on the salient SDOH issues, defined based on the Accountable Health Communities Model health-related social needs screening tool. Five of the organizations reported lobbying on some SDOH issues, including financial strain, employment, food insecurity, and interpersonal safety, but none reported lobbying on other issues, such as non-healthcare-related employment, housing instability, transportation, or education. Lobbying has been a missed opportunity for addressing SDOH. Healthcare organizations have the opportunity to expand their lobbying on upstream SDOH policy issues to increase the impact of their SDOH strategy and further improve population health.","['Health policy', 'Healthcare reform', 'Social determinants of health']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106751,1,True
American Journal Of Public Health,2021,Racial Disparities of E-Cigarette Use Among US Youths: 2014–2019,"Objectives. To evaluate disparities in youth e-cigarette use patterns and flavor use by race/ethnicity over time. Methods. We used data from the US 2014–2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) to examine trends in dual use (co-use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes or other tobacco products), occasional (# 5 days) versus frequent use ($ 20 days) in the past 30 days, and flavor use among current (past-30-day) e-cigarette users (n 5 13 178) across racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, and non-Hispanic others). Results. Among current e-cigarette users, dual use and occasional use decreased significantly from 2014 to 2019 across racial and ethnic groups except for non-Hispanic Blacks; frequent use and flavored e-cigarette use increased among non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics/Latinos, and non-Hispanic others but not among non-Hispanic Blacks. In 2019, non-Hispanic Black e-cigarette users were more likely to report dual use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5 1.5, 3.2; P, .001) and occasional use of e-cigarettes (AOR 5 3.7; 95% CI 5 2.3, 5.9; P, .001) but less likely to report frequent use (AOR 5 0.2; 95% CI 5 0.1, 0.4; P, .001) and flavored e-cigarette use (AOR 5 0.4; 95% CI 5 0.3, 0.5; P, .001) than their White peers. Conclusions. Youth e-cigarette use patterns differed considerably across racial/ethnic groups, and tailored strategies to address disparities in e-cigarette use are needed.",[],10.2105/AJPH.2021.306448,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2023,Prevalence and correlates of knife-related victimization: Insights from the 2019 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample,"Few studies have explored the incidence and general trends in knife-related victimizations in the United States (US), especially in settings where preventive interventions can potentially be initiated such as emergency departments (EDs). The goal of the present investigation was to provide an empirical portrait of the psychosocial and behavioral health characteristics of patients assaulted by sharp objects, particularly knives, as revealed in EDs in the US, as less research has focused on knife victimization in the US than internationally. This study uses data from the 2019 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), which is part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project distributed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Findings revealed that demographically males (especially those aged 18–25), those in poverty, and members of racially minoritized groups were more likely to be present with knife-related assault. Key factors increasing the odds of knife-related victimization treated in EDs were homelessness, legal involvement, and substance use, particularly alcohol and stimulant use disorder. Somewhat surprisingly, mental health diagnosis was not associated with increased knife-related victimization. Although EDs are critical to treating knife-related victimization, they are also potentially key points to launch prevention for high-risk individuals to reduce subsequent violence stemming from escalation of interpersonal disputes.","['Criminology', 'Emergency medicine', 'Exposure to violence', 'Health status disparities', 'Poverty', 'Substance use disorder', 'Victimization']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2023.107680,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2021,Can mental health competence reduce the higher risk of smoking initiation among teenagers with parents who smoke?,"Background: Parental smoking strongly influences adolescent smoking, yet few studies have examined factors that may protect against this. We investigated whether skills-based components of positive mental health ('mental health competence', MHC) modified the association between parental and teenager smoking, in the UKrepresentative Millennium Cohort Study (approximately 18 000 children, born 2000 02; analytic sample: n = 10 133). Methods: Cohort members (CMs) reported at 14 years (y) whether they had ever smoked cigarettes. A dichotomized variable indicated whether one/both parents smoked when CMs were 11 y. A four-class latent MHC measure captured learning skills and prosocial behaviours at 11 y: High, High Moderate, Moderate, Low. We examined effect measure modification (on the additive scale) by comparing risk differences (RDs) for CM smoking according to parental smoking, within each MHC class. We then estimated RDs for CM smoking according to combinations of parental smoking and MHC. Analyses accounted for confounding, sample design, attrition and item missingness. Results: CMs were more likely to smoke cigarettes if their parent(s) smoked (27%) than CMs with no parent(s) who smoked (11%; RD: 16%). When stratified by MHC, RDs were stronger for low MHC (21%; 95% CI 11 31%) than other MHC classes (ranging: 7 11%). Compared to CMs with high MHC and non-smoker parents, those with low MHC and parent(s) who smoked had an RD of 28% (95% CI 20 36%). This was greater than the sum of RDs for those with low MHC and non-smoker parent(s) [7% (2 14%)] plus those with high MHC and whose parent(s) smoked [11% (7 15%)]. There was limited effect measure modification by moderate or High Moderate MHC. Conclusion: Improving MHC to moderate levels may help reduce intergenerational transference of smoking.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckab102,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2024,Effect of Universal Credit on young children's mental health: Quasi-experimental evidence from Understanding Society,"Background Child mental health has become an increasingly important issue in the UK, especially in the context of significant welfare reforms. Universal Credit (UC) has introduced substantial changes to the UK's social security system, significantly impacting low-income families. Our aim was to assess the effects of UC's introduction on children's mental health for families eligible for UC versus a comparable non-eligible sample. Methods Using Understanding Society data from 5806 observations of 4582 children (aged 5 or 8 years) in Great Britain between 2012 and 2018, we created two groups: children whose parents were eligible for UC (intervention group) and children whose parents were ineligible for UC (comparison group). Child mental health was assessed using a parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The OR and percentage point change in the prevalence of children experiencing mental health difficulties between the intervention group and the comparison group following the introduction of UC were analysed. We also investigated whether the utilisation of childcare services and changes in household income were mechanisms by which UC impacted children's mental health. Results Logistic regression results demonstrated that the prevalence of mental health problems among eligible children whose parents were unemployed increased by an OR of 2.18 (95% CI 1.14 to 4.18), equivalent to an 8-percentage point increase (95% CI 1 to 14 percentage points) following the introduction of UC, relative to the comparison group. Exploring potential mechanisms, we found neither reduced household income nor increased use of childcare services, which served as a proxy for reduced time spent with parents, significantly influenced children's mental health. Conclusions UC has led to an increase in mental health problems among recipient children, particularly for children in larger families and those aged 8. Policymakers should carefully evaluate the potential health consequences for specific demographics when introducing new welfare policies.","['CHILD HEALTH', 'ECONOMICS', 'HEALTH POLICY', 'MENTAL HEALTH']",10.1136/jech-2024-222293,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2020,Physical activity trajectories from childhood to late adolescence and their implications for health in young adulthood,"Physical activity has been associated with physical and mental health across the life course, yet few studies have used group-based trajectory modeling to examine the effect of longitudinal patterns of physical activity during childhood and adolescence on adult health outcomes. The Raine Study data from Gen2 follow-ups at 8, 10, 14, 17, 20, and 22 years collected between 1998 and 2014 were used. Latent class analysis identified trajectories using parent-reported physical activity for ages 8 to 17. Associations between trajectories and physical and mental health outcomes at ages 20 and 22 were explored, adjusting for current physical activity and considering sex interactions. Analysis in 2019 identified three trajectories: low (13%), mid (65%) and high (22%) physical activity (n = 1628). Compared to the low-activity trajectory, those in the high-activity trajectory had lower adiposity, insulin, HOMA-IR and fewer diagnosed disorders, higher HDL-cholesterol, and faster cognitive processing. For example, those in the high-activity trajectory had lower percent body fat at age 20 compared to those in the mid-activity (−4.2%, 95%CI: −5.8, −2.7) and low-activity (−9.5%, 95%CI: −11.7, −7.2) trajectories. Physical activity trajectories showed different associations between sexes for self-reported physical and mental health, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and depression symptoms. Being in the high- or mid-activity trajectory was associated with a more favorable cardiometabolic and mental health profile in young adulthood. Strategies are needed to help less active children to increase physical activity throughout childhood and adolescence to improve young adult health outcomes.","['Body composition', 'Cohort', 'Life course', 'Longitudinal', 'Obesity', 'Physical activity']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106224,1,True
European Journal Of Epidemiology,2022,SARS-CoV-2 infections in professional orchestra and choir musicians—a prospective cohort study,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, rehearsal and concert activities of professional orchestras and choirs were severely restricted based on the assumption of particularly high infection risks associated with wind instruments and singing. Therefore, our primary objective was to determine the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in orchestra and choir musicians compared to controls. We also assessed influenza, flu, upper respiratory tract infections, and course of illness. Musicians from professional orchestras and choirs and controls from 23 institutions throughout Germany were included in a prospective cohort study. Data were collected from October 2020 to June 2021 by weekly online surveys. A mixed-effects cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the effect of exposure by professional activity on SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 1,097 participants (46.7 years (SD 10.3); 46.8% female; 705 orchestra, 154 choir, and 238 control subjects) 40 SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred. Cases per person-years were 0.06 in orchestras, 0.11 in choirs, and 0.03 in controls. Hazard ratios compared to controls were 1.74 (95% CI 0.58 to 5.25, p = 0.320) for orchestra musicians and 2.97 (0.87 to 10.28, p = 0.087) for choir singers. Infection source was suspected predominantly in private contexts. Disease courses were mild to moderate. Other respiratory infections were reported in 6.1% of study weeks in orchestras, 10.1% in choirs, and 8.0% in controls. Sick leave days of total study days were 0.5, 2.1 and 1.3%, respectively. This epidemiologic study during the pandemic in professional musicians indicates no increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections in orchestra musicians and a trend towards increased risk in choir singers compared to controls. However, the exact routes of infection could not be validated. If appropriate hygiene concepts are adhered to, safe orchestra and choir activity appears possible in pandemic times.","['Cohort study', 'Coronavirus SARS', 'Incidence', 'Occupational health']",10.1007/s10654-022-00917-x,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2020,Potassium Intake in India: Opportunity for Mitigating Risks of High-Sodium Diets,"Introduction: Most Indians are vegetarian or eat very little meat, which could imply high potassium intake. Because a high-potassium diet could counterbalance the adverse health effects of high-sodium intake, this study aimed to describe potassium relative to sodium intake and investigate the relationship between blood pressure and potassium intake relative to sodium intake in rural and urban India. Methods: Investigators collected 24-hour urines from 1,445 participants in a subset of 2 population-based surveys in North India in 2012–2013. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect information on demography, behaviors (tobacco, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and diet [food frequency and 24-hour recall]), and medical history. After evaluating expected versus measured creatinine excretion, the authors calculated median urine potassium excretion and sodium/potassium ratio, according to sex and urban or rural residence, and estimated least square means for the urine measures by participant demographics and comorbidities, after accounting for caloric intake. Two-year blood pressure follow-up data were available in the urban study, and ANCOVA regression was used to determine the association with urine measures. All the statistical analyses of the data were done in January 2019. Results: Acceptable 24-hour urine collections were available in 1,397 participants (rural, n=730). Median urine potassium excretions were 1,492 (IQR=1,012−2,063) and 975 (615–1,497) mg/day; sodium/potassium ratios met the recommended target of <1 in 2.9% rural and 6.6% urban participants. Rural participants did not have higher potassium or lower (better) sodium/potassium ratios when diagnosed with hypertension or other cardiovascular conditions. Higher potassium excretion was associated with lower blood pressure during follow-up among the urban participants (mean systolic blood pressure, 129 vs 133 mm Hg in highest vs lowest potassium excretion tertiles; p=0.029). Conclusions: Low potassium intake in India warrants dietary policies promoting intake of potassium-rich foods to improve heart health. This approach may be more acceptable than programs focused on sodium reduction alone.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2019.09.017,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2023,"Trends in past-month cannabis use among US adults across a range of disabilities and health conditions, 2015–2019","Introduction: While there is increasing interest in the use of cannabis to manage a range of health-related symptoms, little is known about trends in recent cannabis use with respect to various health conditions. Methods: We examined data from a US representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults age ≥ 18 from the 2015–2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 214,505). We estimated the pooled prevalences followed by linear time trends, overall, and by disability (i.e., difficulty hearing, seeing, thinking, walking, dressing, doing errands) and lifetime (i.e., bronchitis, cancer, diabetes, hepatitis, kidney disease) and current (i.e., asthma, depression, heart disease, hypertension) health condition status using logistic regression. Models with year-by-condition status interaction terms were used to assess differential time trends, adjusting for demographic characteristics. Results: From 2015 to 2019, cannabis use increased significantly among adults with and without each disability and health condition examined. However, the increase was more rapid among those with (versus without) difficulty hearing (89.8% increase [4.9% to 9.3%] vs. 37.9% increase [8.7% to 12.0%], p = 0.015), difficulty walking (84.1% increase [6.3% to 11.6%] vs. 36.8% increase [8.7% to 11.9%], p < 0.001), 2–3 impairments (75.3% increase [9.3% to 16.3%] vs. 36.6% increase [8.2% to 11.2%], p = 0.041), and kidney disease (135.3% increase [3.4% to 8.0%] vs. 38.4% increase [8.6% to 11.9%], p = 0.045). Conclusion: Given the potential adverse effects of cannabis, prevention and harm reduction efforts should focus on groups at increasingly higher risk for use, including those with disabilities and kidney disease.","['Cannabis', 'Disability', 'Functional impairment', 'Health conditions', 'Marijuana', 'Trends']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2023.107768,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2021,A Feasibility Study of Primary Care Liaisons: Linking Older Adults to Community Resources,"Introduction: Programs and services available through the aging services network can help community-dwelling older adults to age in place but are often not discussed in routine primary care. The primary care liaison was developed as a novel integration intervention to address this disconnect. Methods: Employed by an Area Agency on Aging, primary care liaisons performed outreach to primary care with the goal of raising awareness of community-based programs, resources, and services available to older adults and their caregivers and facilitating referrals. The evaluation of the primary care liaison model, conducted from December 2015 to February 2019, used the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework and assessed reach (number of clinics contacted), adoption (number of referrals to the Area Agency on Aging), implementation (number of follow-up contacts with a practice), and effectiveness (proportion of referrals reached and provided relevant resources). Results: The primary care liaisons contacted a median of 18.5 clinics per month (IQR=15−31). Primary care referrals averaged >100 per month, and referrals increased over time. Successful follow-up outreach visits had a median of 3 (IQR=2−10), and follow-up contacts had a median of 3 (IQR=1−7) per practice. Three quarters of caregivers for people with dementia reached by Area Agency on Aging staff were provided with information about relevant resources. Conclusions: The primary care liaison model is feasible, fosters ongoing interactions between primary care and Area Agencies on Aging, and connects older adults and their caregivers to relevant programs and services. Adoption of the primary care liaison model by other Area Agencies on Aging across the U.S. may help further the vision of optimized health and well-being of older adults.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2021.05.034,1,True
American Journal Of Epidemiology,2023,Enhancing Epidemiology’s Impact on Policy: Mediation by Expert Committees,"Epidemiologic evidence is often a key source of information used by expert committees to guide policy decisions, yet epidemiologists rarely consider this audience for their research. For a better understanding of the pipeline from epidemiologic research to expert committee assessment to policy, several reports from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine were reviewed and discussed with staff and committee members. The topics of these consensus committee assessments included health behaviors, medical care, and military exposures. The focus was often on emerging issues of immediate concern for which there was little relevant research available but a need for prompt action. Committees generally sought a comprehensive assessment of potential health effects of a given product or exposure, which often included social and behavioral health outcomes that are rarely addressed by epidemiologists. To enhance epidemiology’s contribution to societal decisions, the choice of research topics should expand to consider emerging societal concerns. Research funding agencies need to be engaged as mediators between committee needs and the research community to stimulate contributory research. Improved communication of research needs to the epidemiology community would be beneficial to researchers aspiring to have an impact and to those who use epidemiologic information to help guide policy decisions.","['consequentialist epidemiology', 'expert committees', 'health policy']",10.1093/aje/kwad078,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2024,Gestational Weight Gain Among Urban and Rural Pregnant Individuals Who Smoke or Quit Smoking,"Introduction: Approximately 7.2% of individuals in the U.S. smoke during pregnancy, and cessation is associated with excessive gestational weight gain (GWG). Weight gain is a common reason for not quitting smoking or relapsing. The current study aimed to characterize who is at risk for excessive GWG and determine the moderating effect of rurality given the higher smoking rates and lower access to healthcare services in these areas. Methods: Data from the Virginia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS; years 2009–2020) were used to assess the association between participant characteristics, smoking behaviors, and rurality by excessive GWG status in 2023. Results: Almost half (44.0%) of participants experienced excessive GWG; 9.8% of participants quit smoking while 6.9% continued smoking. Respondents who quit during pregnancy had higher odds of excessive GWG than non-smoking respondents (OR=1.83, 95% CI: [1.24, 2.71]). Among those who were non-smoking, respondents in rural areas, compared to urban areas, had a higher probability of experiencing excessive GWG (0.46 vs 0.44, p<0.001). For those who quit smoking (0.60 vs 0.41, p<0.001) or continued to smoke during pregnancy (0.46 vs 0.33, p<0.001), urban residence was associated with a higher likelihood of excessive GWG compared to rural residence. Conclusions: Smoking cessation and weight management during pregnancy are critical to promoting infant and maternal health. Targeted interventions combining weight management and smoking cessation have been successful among the general population and could be adapted for pregnant individuals who smoke to facilitate cessation and healthy GWG in both urban and rural areas.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2023.12.010,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2022,Ethnic differences in functional limitations: a comparison of older migrants and native Dutch older population,"Background: Although the older migrants population in Europe is expected to grow substantially in the coming years, there is little information about their health status and particularly functional limitations. This study examined the association of ethnicity and mobility, hearing and visual limitations in comparison to the general population in the Netherlands, and whether relevant characteristics explained the potential differences between older migrants and non-migrants. Methods: Secondary data analysis of 12 652 subjects 55 years and older who participated in the health survey in the four largest Dutch cities. To establish limitations in vision, hearing and mobility, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) questionnaire was used. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between limitations and ethnic background, subsequently adjusting for demographic and socio-economic characteristics and relevant health- and lifestyle-related factors. Results: Older migrants had higher prevalences of functional limitations. The age- and- gender adjusted ORs were 2 to 8-fold compared with older non-migrants. After adjusting for socioeconomic status and health-and lifestyle indicators, Moroccan, Turkish and Surinamese migrants still had increased ORs for visual limitations [ORs (95% CI), respectively: 2.48 (1.49-4.14), 3.08 (1.75-5.41) and 1.97 (1.33-2.91)] compared with the Dutch. For mobility limitations, only the Turkish migrants had an OR twice as high (2.19; 1.08-4.44) as the non-migrants. No significant differences were found between Antillean/Aruban migrants and non-migrants. Conclusions: Important ethnic inequalities exist in various functional limitations, particularly in vision. These results underline the importance of tailored preventive interventions in older migrants to detect and prevent these limitations at an early stage.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckab080,1,True
The Lancet Public Health,2020,Diagnosis of physical and mental health conditions in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective cohort study,"Background: To date, research on the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of the population and the health-care system is scarce. We aimed to investigate the indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on general practice health-care usage, and the subsequent diagnoses of common physical and mental health conditions in a deprived UK population. Methods: We did a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected primary care data that was recorded in the Salford Integrated Record between Jan 1, 2010, and May 31, 2020. We extracted the weekly number of clinical codes entered into patient records overall, and for six high-level categories: symptoms and observations, diagnoses, prescriptions, operations and procedures, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic procedures. Negative binomial regression models were applied to monthly counts of first diagnoses of common conditions (common mental health problems, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer), and corresponding first prescriptions of medications indicative of these conditions. We used these models to predict the expected numbers of first diagnoses and first prescriptions between March 1 and May 31, 2020, which were then compared with the observed numbers for the same time period. Findings: Between March 1 and May 31, 2020, 1073 first diagnoses of common mental health problems were reported compared with 2147 expected cases (95% CI 1821 to 2489) based on preceding years, representing a 50·0% reduction (95% CI 41·1 to 56·9). Compared with expected numbers, 456 fewer diagnoses of circulatory system diseases (43·3% reduction, 95% CI 29·6 to 53·5), and 135 fewer type 2 diabetes diagnoses (49·0% reduction, 23·8 to 63·1) were observed. The number of first prescriptions of associated medications was also lower than expected for the same time period. However, the gap between observed and expected cancer diagnoses (31 fewer; 16·0% reduction, −18·1 to 36·6) during this time period was not statistically significant. Interpretation: In this deprived urban population, diagnoses of common conditions decreased substantially between March and May 2020, suggesting a large number of patients have undiagnosed conditions. A rebound in future workload could be imminent as COVID-19 restrictions ease and patients with undiagnosed conditions or delayed diagnosis present to primary and secondary health-care services. Such services should prioritise the diagnosis and treatment of these patients to mitigate potential indirect harms to protect public health.

American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2020,Poor Health and Violent Crime Hot Spots: Mitigating the Undesirable Co-Occurrence Through Focused Place-Based Interventions,"Introduction: The geographic overlap of violence and poor health is a major public health concern. To understand whether and how place-based interventions targeting micro-geographic places can reduce this undesirable co-occurrence, the study addresses 2 important questions. First, to what extent are deteriorated health conditions associated with living at violent crime hot spots? Second, through what mechanisms can focused place-based interventions break the association between living with violence and deteriorated health? Methods: This study used survey data from 2,724 respondents living on 328 street segments that were categorized as violent crime hot spots (181 segments with 1,532 respondents) versus non–hot spots (147 segments with 1,192 respondents) in 2013–2014 in Baltimore, Maryland. Propensity score analysis assessed whether individuals living at violent crime hot spots had lower general health perceptions than people living at non–hot spots. Marginal structural models estimated the proportion of total effects mediated by 3 theoretically informed intervening mechanisms. Analyses were conducted in 2019. Results: Respondents living at violent crime hot spots had a lower level of self-rated general health (b= −0.096, 95% CI= −0.176, −0.015) and higher levels of health limitations (b=0.068, 95% CI=0.027, 0.109) and problems (OR=2.026, 95% CI=1.225, 3.349) than those living at non–hot spots. Enhanced perceptions of safety, collective efficacy, and police legitimacy may break the association between living in places with extremely high levels of violence and deteriorated health. Conclusions: Indicated or selective strategies are urgently needed to target micro-geographic locations with known increased risks, supplementing universal strategies applied to a broader community.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2019.12.012,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2022,"Investigating the impact of a 20 miles per hour speed limit intervention on road traffic collisions, casualties, speed and volume in Belfast, UK: 3 year follow-up outcomes of a natural experiment","Background Evidence regarding the effectiveness of 20 miles per hour (mph) speed limit interventions is limited, and rarely have long-term outcomes been assessed. We investigate the effect of a 20 mph speed limit intervention on road traffic collisions, casualties, speed and volume at 1 and 3 years post-implementation. Methods An observational, repeated cross-sectional design was implemented, using routinely collected data for road traffic collisions, casualties, speed and volume. We evaluated difference-in-differences in collisions and casualties (intervention vs control) across three different time series and traffic speed and volume pre-implementation, at 1 and 3 years post-implementation. Results Small reductions in road traffic collisions were observed at year 1 (3%; p=0.82) and year 3 post-implementation (15%; p=0.31) at the intervention site. Difference-in-differences analyses showed no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control sites over time for road traffic collisions. There were 16% (p=0.18) and 22% (p=0.06) reductions in casualty rates at years 1 and 3 post-implementation, respectively, at the intervention site. Results showed little change in mean traffic speed at year 1 (0.2 mph, 95% CI -0.3 to 2.4, p=0.14) and year 3 post-implementation (0.8, 95% CI -1.5 to 2.5, p=0.17). For traffic volume, a decrease in 57 vehicles per week was observed at year 1 (95% CI -162 to -14, p<0.00) and 71 vehicles at year 3 (95% CI -213 to 1, p=0.05) post-implementation. Conclusion A 20 mph speed limit intervention implemented at city centre scale had little impact on long-term outcomes including road traffic collisions, casualties and speed, except for a reduction in traffic volume. Policymakers considering implementing 20 mph speed limit interventions should consider the fidelity, context and scale of implementation.","['EPIDEMIOLOGY', 'PREVENTION', 'PUBLIC HEALTH']",10.1136/jech-2022-219729,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2024,"Time Series Analysis: Associations Between Temperature and Primary Care Utilization in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Introduction: Earth's temperature has risen by an average of 0.11°F per decade since 1850 and experts predict continued global warming. Studies have shown that exposure to extreme temperatures is associated with adverse health outcomes. Missed primary care visits can lead to incomplete preventive health screenings and unmanaged chronic diseases. This study examines the associations between extreme temperature conditions and primary care utilization among adult Philadelphians. Methods: A total of 1,048,575 appointments from 91,580 patients age ≥ 18 years enrolled in the study at thirteen university-based outpatient clinics in Philadelphia from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2019. Statistical analysis was performed from June to December 2023. Data on attended and missed appointments was linked with measures of daily maximum temperature and precipitation, stratified by warm and cold seasons. Sociodemographic variables and associations with chronic disease status were explored. Results: Rates of missed appointments increased by 0.72% for every 1°F decrease in daily maximum temperatures below 39°F and increased by 0.64% for every 1°F increase above 89°F. Individuals ≥ 65 years and those with chronic conditions had stronger associations with an increased rate of missed appointments. Conclusions: Temperature extremes were associated with higher rates of missed primary care appointments. Individuals with chronic diseases were more likely to have missed appointments associated with extreme temperatures. The findings suggest the need for primary care physicians to explore different modes of care delivery to support vulnerable populations, such as making telemedicine during extreme weather events a viable and affordable option.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2024.06.014,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2022,"Associations Among Military Sexual Trauma, Opioid Use Disorder, and Gender","Introduction: Opioid use disorder and high-risk opioid prescription increase the risks for overdose and death. In Veterans, military sexual trauma is associated with increased risk for assorted health conditions. This study evaluates the association of military sexual trauma with opioid use disorder and high-risk opioid prescription and potential moderation by gender. Methods: In a national sample of Veterans Health Administration outpatients receiving care from October 1, 2009 to August 1, 2017, logistic regression models were fit to evaluate the associations between military sexual trauma and opioid use disorder and high-risk opioid prescription, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. A second set of models included a gender X military sexual trauma interaction. Analyses were conducted in 2020–2021. Results: Patients with history of military sexual trauma (n=327,193) had 50% higher odds of opioid use disorder diagnosis (AOR=1.50, 95% CI=1.45, 1.54, p<0.001) and 5% higher odds of high-risk opioid prescription (AOR=1.05, 95% CI=1.04, 1.07, p<0.001) than those without history of military sexual trauma (n=7,738,665). The effect of military sexual trauma on opioid use disorder was stronger in men than in women. The predicted probability of opioid use disorder among men with history of military sexual trauma (1.5%) was nearly double that of women with history of military sexual trauma (0.8%). Conclusions: Military sexual trauma was a significant risk factor for opioid use disorder and high-risk opioid prescription, with the former association particularly strong in men. Clinical care for Veterans with military sexual trauma should consider elevated risk of opioid use disorder and high-risk opioid prescription.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2021.08.020,1,True
American Journal Of Public Health,2021,"US State Disparities in Life Expectancy, Disability-Free Life Expectancy, and Disabled Life Expectancy Among Adults Aged 25 to 89 Years","Objectives. To estimate total life expectancy (TLE), disability-free life expectancy (DFLE), and disabled life expectancy (DLE) by US state for women and men aged 25 to 89 years and examine the cross-state patterns. Methods. We used data from the 2013-2017 American Community Survey and the 2017 US Mortality Database to calculate state-specific TLE, DFLE, and DLE by gender for US adults and hypothetical worstand best-case scenarios. Results. For men and women, DFLEs and DLEs varied widely by state. Among women, DFLE ranged from 45.8 years in West Virginia to 52.5 years in Hawaii, a 6.7-year gap. Men had a similar range. The gap in DLEs across states was 2.4 years for women and 1.6 years for men. The correlation among DFLE, DLE, and TLE was particularly strong in southern states. The South is doubly disadvantaged: residents have shorter lives and spend a greater proportion of those lives with disability. Conclusions. The stark variation in DFLE and DLE across states highlights the large health inequalities present today across the United States, which have significant implications for individuals' well-being and US states' financial costs and medical care burden.",[],10.2105/AJPH.2020.306064,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2024,The impact of the introduction of tobacco product plain packaging on consumer responses in Ireland: A real-world policy evaluation stratified by socioeconomic groups,"Smoking prevalence remains high in Europe and widening socioeconomic group differences are driving health inequalities. While plain packaging policies disrupt tobacco industry tactics that sustain smoking, evidence of their equity impact is sparse. This study evaluated the implementation of plain packaging in Ireland in 2018 on consumer responses, overall and by the socioeconomic group. Consecutive nationally representative cross-sectional surveys (2018, n = 7701 and 2019, n = 7382) measured changes in 13 consumer responses among respondents who smoked across three domains: product appeal, health warnings effectiveness, and perceived harmfulness of smoking. Multiple logistic regression-derived adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals to compare responses post- versus pre-implementation adjusting for age, gender, educational level, and heaviness of smoking. A stratified analysis examined changes by socioeconomic group indexed using educational level. There were statistically significant changes in consumer responses to plain packaging policy implementation across 7/13 outcomes studied. Five changes were aligned with expected policy impacts (2/6 product appeal outcomes and 3/4 health warning effectiveness outcomes). Two responses were also observed which were not expected policy impacts (1 appeal-related and 1 perceived harm-related outcome). There was no change in five outcomes. Differences in consumer responses between educational groups were generally small, mixed in nature, and indistinguishable when interval estimates of effect were compared. Implementation of plain packaging in Ireland had intended impacts on consumer responses. Including plain packaging requirements in revising the European Union's legislative frameworks for tobacco control will help build progress towards a Tobacco-Free Europe without exacerbating smoking inequalities.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckae128,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2024,Estimating the Population Newly Eligible for the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine,"Introduction: Recommendations for adult pneumococcal vaccination in the U.S. were revised in 2022 after the introduction of 15- and 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15 and PCV20) to call for routine PCV use among immunocompetent adults with risk conditions aged 19–64 years. The present study estimated the size of this newly recommended population. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Optum de-identified electronic health record (EHR) dataset. Patients who were active in the EHR between January 2016 and June 2021 and had ≥1 condition included in the current pneumococcal recommendation without an immunocompromising condition were included. Data were weighted to account for potential differences between the EHR and U.S. population. Data analyses were conducted in 2022. Results: Of 45.6 million adults aged 19–64 years in the database, 12.5 million met inclusion criteria and had ≥1 qualifying condition, primarily smoking, with chronic lung disease/asthma and/or diabetes also common. After weighting, the U.S. population aged 19–64 years newly eligible for PCVs was approximately 56 million. Conclusions: Approximately one in four U.S. adults aged <65 years is now recommended to receive PCV15 or PCV20, which highlights the need for providers to assess vaccination status, administer the vaccine, or refer patients as appropriate, as well as the need for tools to facilitate patient identification and vaccination.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2023.09.002,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2021,Associations between neighbourhood built characteristics and sedentary behaviours among Canadian men and women: findings from Alberta's Tomorrow Project,"Evidence of associations between neighbourhood built characteristics and sedentary behaviours is mixed. The study aim was to investigate the associations between objectively-derived neighbourhood built characteristics and self-reported sedentary behaviours among Canadian men and women. This study sourced survey data from Alberta's Tomorrow Project (2008; n = 14,785), in which sitting and motor vehicle travel times during the last 7 days was measured. Geographic Information System was used to calculate neighbourhood built characteristics within a 400 m buffer of participant's home and a walkability score was estimated. To estimate the associations between neighbourhood characteristics and sedentary behaviours, covariate-adjusted generalized linear regression models were used. Walkability, 3-way intersections, and population count were positively associated with sitting time. Business destinations and greenness were negatively associated with sitting time. Walkability, 3-way, and 4-way intersections were negatively associated with motor vehicle travel time. Sex-specific associations between neighbourhood characteristics and sedentary behaviour were found. Among men, business destinations were negatively associated with sitting time, and 3-way intersections, population count, and walkability were negatively associated with motor vehicle travel time. Among women, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was negatively associated with sitting time. Interventions to reduce sedentary behaviours may need to target neighbourhoods that have built characteristics which might support these behaviours. More research is needed to disentangle the complex relationships between different neighbourhood built characteristics and specific types of sedentary behaviour.","['Built environment', 'Motor vehicle travel time', 'Neighbourhood', 'Sedentary behaviour', 'Sitting time', 'Walkability']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106663,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2023,Changes in Household Challenges and Subsequent Child Welfare Report,"Introduction: Preventing child maltreatment and reducing adverse childhood experiences is critical for improving adult health. To inform prevention efforts, it is necessary to move beyond static risk models and instead model the dynamic changes in household challenges during the prebirth and early childhood periods. This study examined the effect of changes in the number of household challenges from prebirth (12 months before birth of a child) to early childhood (3 years after birth) period on the risk of a child maltreatment report by age 3 years. Methods: This retrospective cohort study linked data from the Alaska 2009–2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, its 3-year follow-up survey, and administrative records through 2019. Participants were 1,699 birthing parents. Latent class analyses identified prebirth and early childhood low- and high-challenge respondent groups on the basis of the level of reported household challenges. The authors then modeled the relationships between group transition membership and the risk of maltreatment using latent transition analysis. Analyses were conducted in 2021. Results: Households transitioning from a high-challenge-prebirth status to a low-challenge-early-childhood status had a lower predicted risk for child services report than households remaining in the high-challenges group. Transitioning from low- to high-challenges status predicted the highest risk for child services report than that of all other groups. Conclusions: To reduce the risk of child maltreatment and subsequent adverse childhood experiences, healthcare providers should screen parents for the presence of household challenges during both pregnancy and early childhood and connect patients to resources targeted at reducing those challenges and providing continuous familial support.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2022.12.009,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2020,The perception of youth health centres' friendliness: Does it differ between immigrant and Swedish-Scandinavian youths?,"Background: Ensuring a good quality service and equal access according to need for all young people is a key objective of the Swedish health system. The aim of this study was to explore youths' perception of youth health centres' (YHCs') friendliness and to assess the differences in perception between immigrant and Swedish-Scandinavian youths. Methods: All YHCs in the four northern counties in Sweden were invited (22 centres), and 20 agreed to participate. Overall, 1089 youths aged 16-25 years answered the youth-friendly health services-Sweden questionnaire between September 2016 and February 2017. Thirteen sub-domains of friendliness were identified and their scores were calculated. Multilevel analysis was used to examine the differences in perception between immigrant and Swedish-Scandinavian youths. Results: Our sample consisted of 971 Swedish-Scandinavian youths (89.2%) and 118 immigrants (10.8%). Generally, both groups perceived the services to be very friendly. All 13 sub-domains were rated more than three in a four-point scale except for fear of exposure and parental support of psychosocial services. However, immigrant youths perceived YHCs less friendly than their counterparts, particularly regarding the domains of equity, respect, quality and parental support. Conclusions: Our study suggests that even though youths perceived YHCs as highly friendly, there is a space for improvement regarding access to health care. Our findings highlight the importance of an open and culturally sensitive attitude of the staff and the need to engage parents and community as a key to improve immigrant youths' accessibility to health care.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckaa077,1,True

For this task, we conducted a data-driven, longitudinal analysis using a multilevel modelling approach with both maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation. We found that during the early phase of the epidemic: implementing restrictions on gatherings of more than 100 people, between 11 and 100 people, and 10 people or less was associated with a respective average reduction of 2.58%, 2.78% and 2.81% in the daily growth rate in weekly confirmed cases; requiring closing for some sectors or for all but essential workplaces with an average reduction of 1.51% and 1.78%; requiring closing of some school levels or all school levels with an average reduction of 1.12% or 1.65%; recommending mask wearing with an average reduction of 0.45%, requiring mask wearing country-wide in specific public spaces or in specific geographical areas within the country with an average reduction of 0.44%, requiring mask-wearing country-wide in all public places or all public places where social distancing is not possible with an average reduction of 0.96%; and number of tests per thousand population with an average reduction of 0.02% per unit increase. Between October and December 2020 work closing requirements and testing policy were significant predictors of the epidemic growth rate. These findings provide evidence to support policy decision-making regarding which NPIs to implement to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","['COVID-19', 'Generalized linear mixed models', 'Linear mixed models', 'Longitudinal analysis', 'Non-pharmaceutical interventions', 'OECD']",10.1007/s10654-021-00766-0,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2024,"Time poverty, health and health-related behaviours in a Southern European city: A gender issue","Background Despite its growing interest, time poverty is a neglected issue in public health analysis and policies. The objectives of this study were: (1) to analyse gender differences in paid, unpaid and total working time; (2) to identify gender differences in the factors related to time poverty; and (3) to examine gender differences in the relationship between time poverty, health and health-related behaviours in the city of Barcelona (Spain). Methods Cross-sectional study based on salaried workers aged 16-64 years interviewed in the 2021 Barcelona Health Survey (695 men and 713 women). Time poverty was defined as the top tercile of the total paid and unpaid work. Dependent variables were self-perceived health status, mental health, sleep time, sleep quality and leisure time physical activity. Results Women were more likely to be time poor. In both sexes, time poverty was related to the number of children. Whereas among men time poverty was not associated with any health indicators, among women it was related to poor mental health status (aOR=2.11, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.20), short sleep (aOR=1.54, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.25), poor sleep quality (aOR=1.83, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.68) and low leisure time physical activity (aOR=1.50, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.26). Conclusions This study suggests that time use can be an important social determinant of health and of gender inequalities in health. At the local level, in many European cities, time poverty could be reduced, among other interventions, by increasing affordable and good quality public services for the care of dependent persons.","['employment', 'health', 'health inequalities', 'poverty']",10.1136/jech-2023-220750,1,True

This study explores granular associations between BCS and patient sociodemographic factors in a large urban safety-net health system. Methods: A retrospective review among female patients ages 50–74 within an urban safety-net health system was conducted in 2019. All patients had a primary care visit in the past 2 years. Multiple patient health and sociodemographic characteristics were reviewed, as well as provider gender and specialty. Bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression were performed in 2022. Results: The BCS rate among 11,962 women was 69.7%. Over half of patients were non-White (63.6%) and had public insurance (72.3%). Patients with limited English proficiency made up 44.3% of the cohort. Compared to their sociodemographic counterparts, patients with White race, English proficiency, and Medicare insurance had the lowest rates of BCS. Serious mental illness and substance use disorder were associated with lower odds of BCS. In multivariable analysis, when using White race and English speakers as a reference, most other races (Black, Hispanic, and Other) and languages (Spanish, Portuguese, and Other) had significantly higher odds of screening ranging from 8% to 63% higher, except Asian race and Haitian Creole language. Female (versus male) and internal medicine-trained providers were associated with higher screening odds. Conclusions: Multiple unique variables contribute to BCS disparities, influenced by patient and health system factors.

To examine prevalence and predictors of digital health engagement among the US population. Methods. We analyzed nationally representative cross-sectional data on 7 digital health engagement behaviors, as well as demographic and socioeconomic predictors, from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5, cycle 2, collected in 2018; n 5 2698–3504). We fitted multivariable logistic regression models using weighted survey responses to generate population estimates. Results. Digitally seeking health information (70.14%) was relatively common, whereas using health apps (39.53%) and using a digital device to track health metrics (35.37%) or health goal progress (38.99%) were less common. Digitally communicating with one’s health care providers (35.58%) was moderate, whereas sharing health data with providers (17.20%) and sharing health information on social media (14.02%) were uncommon. Being female, younger than 65 years, a college graduate, and a smart device owner positively predicted several digital health engagement behaviors (odds ratio range 5 0.09–4.21; P value range, .001–.03).

European Journal Of Public Health,2023,Children with problem-drinking parents in a Swedish national sample: is the risk of harm related to the severity of parental problem drinking?,"Background: The aim of this paper is to examine the link between severity in exposure to parental problem drinking in a Swedish national population sample of children aged 15-16 years. Specifically, we assessed whether the risk of poor health, poor relationships and a problematic school situation increase with severity in exposure to parental problem drinking. Methods: National population survey from 2017 with a representative sample of 5 576 adolescents born in 2001. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A short version of The Children of Alcoholics Screening Test, CAST-6, was used to identify children with problem-drinking parents. Health status, social relations and school situation were assessed by well-established measures. Results: The risk of having poor health, poor school performance and poor social relations increased with severity of parental problem drinking. The risk was lowest among children least severely affected (Crude models ranged from OR: 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4 to OR: 2.2, 95% CI 1.8-2.6) and highest among children most severely affected (Crude models ranges from OR: 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.1 to OR: 6.6, 95% CI 5.1-8.6). The risk became lower when adjusting for gender and socioeconomic position but were still higher compared to children without problem-drinking parents. Conclusions: Appropriate screening and intervention programs are necessary for children with problem-drinking parents especially when exposure is severe but also at mild forms of exposure.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckad022,1,True

We aimed to assess the uptake of invitations to a lung health check offering low-dose CT lung cancer screening in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse cohort at high risk of lung cancer. Methods: In this multicentre, prospective, longitudinal cohort study (SUMMIT), individuals aged 55–77 years with a history of smoking in the past 20 years were identified via National Health Service England primary care records at practices in northeast and north-central London, UK, using electronic searches. Eligible individuals were invited by letter to a lung health check offering lung cancer screening at one of four hospital sites, with non-responders re-invited after 4 months. Individuals were excluded if they had dementia or metastatic cancer, were receiving palliative care or were housebound, or declined research participation. The proportion of individuals invited who responded to the lung health check invitation by telephone was used to measure uptake. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses to estimate associations between uptake of a lung health check invitation and re-invitation of non-responders, adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, smoking, and deprivation score. This study was registered prospectively with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03934866. Findings: Between March 20 and Dec 12, 2019, the records of 2 333 488 individuals from 251 primary care practices across northeast and north-central London were screened for eligibility; 1 974 919 (84·6%) individuals were outside the eligible age range, 7578 (2·1%) had pre-existing medical conditions, and 11 962 (3·3%) had opted out of particpation in research and thus were not invited. 95 297 individuals were eligible for invitation, of whom 29 545 (31·0%) responded. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, re-invitation letters were sent to only a subsample of 4594 non-responders, of whom 642 (14·0%) responded. Overall, uptake was lower among men than among women (odds ratio [OR] 0·91 [95% CI 0·88–0·94]; p<0·0001), and higher among older age groups (1·48 [1·42–1·54] among those aged 65–69 years vs those aged 55–59 years; p<0·0001), groups with less deprivation (1·89 [1·76–2·04] for the most vs the least deprived areas; p<0·0001), individuals of Asian ethnicity (1·14 [1·09–1·20] vs White ethnicity; p<0·0001), and individuals who were former smokers (1·89 [1·83–1·95] vs current smokers; p<0·0001). When ethnicity was subdivided into 16 groups, uptake was lower among individuals of other White ethnicity than among those with White British ethnicity (0·86 [0·83–0·90]), whereas uptake was higher among Chinese, Indian, and other Asian ethnicities than among those with White British ethnicity (1·33 [1·13–1·56] for Chinese ethnicity; 1·29 [1·19–1·40] for Indian ethnicity; and 1·19 [1·08–1·31] for other Asian ethnicity). Interpretation: Inviting eligible adults for lung health checks in areas of socioeconomic and ethnic diversity should achieve favourable participation in lung cancer screening overall, but inequalities by smoking, deprivation, and ethnicity persist. Reminder and re-invitation strategies should be used to increase uptake and the equity of response. Funding: GRAIL.",[],10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00258-4,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2022,"Appropriateness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis Before Dental Procedures, 2016–2018","Introduction: Prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis is common yet unnecessary for many dental visits. In this analysis, our objective was to assess whether the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis has improved over time. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using dental visits from 2016 to 2018 (data analyzed in 2021) using medical and prescriptions claims data of patients from the U.S. with commercial dental insurance. Antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a ≤2 days’ supply prescription dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit. Appropriateness of prophylaxis was defined on the basis of the manipulation of the gingiva/tooth periapex or oral mucosa perforation in patients with appropriate cardiac diagnoses. Associations between patient and visit characteristics and appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis were assessed using multiple Poisson regression. Results: Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was highly prevalent in this cohort, ranging from 77.0% in 2016 to 78.5% in 2018. In the adjusted analysis, factors associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis included younger age, female sex, geographic region, rurality, type of antibiotic, and certain dental procedures. The factors associated with the highest risk of unnecessary prophylaxis in the adjusted analysis were orthodontic procedures and having a history of a prosthetic joint. Notably, the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time in the adjusted analysis. Conclusions: Unnecessary prescription of antibiotic prophylaxis by dentists continues to be common. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies are needed to improve prescribing by dentists.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2021.11.004,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2024,Increasing awareness for dementia risk reduction through a public awareness campaign in Denmark: A pre-post study,"Objective: It is estimated that about 40% of all dementia cases are potentially attributable to modifiable risk factors, but awareness of this is relatively lacking. Methods: An 18-months nation-wide public awareness campaign on dementia risk reduction was rolled out in Denmark that combined a mass-media approach with an online risk assessment tool and knowledge bank targeting all inhabitants aged between 40 and 75 years. Campaign effects (increase in awareness and knowledge of modifiable dementia risk and protective factors) were assessed via online surveys in two independent random samples before (n = 1003) and after the campaign (n = 1076). Results: After adjusting for differences in educational level between the two samples, there was no significant difference in awareness of dementia risk reduction between the pre-campaign (66.5% aware) and post-campaign (63.4% aware) sample (probit z = −0.08, p = 0.151). The number of correctly identified risk/protective factors was significantly higher in the post-campaign sample. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, self-reported exposure to the campaign was associated with more awareness, better recognition of risk/protective factors, more motivation for and actual implementation of lifestyle changes. Conclusions: This mass-media campaign did not increase overall awareness that dementia risk is partly modifiable. However, exposure to the campaign was associated with more awareness and willingness to take action to improve brain health. Future campaigns should tailor messages to specific subgroups to broaden the reach (e.g., males), co-create materials with the target group, and give special attention to the contribution of metabolic/cardiovascular risk factors to dementia risk.","['Awareness', 'Brain health', 'Dementia', 'Health promotion', 'Knowledge', 'Lifestyle', 'Prevention', 'Public health', 'Risk factor', 'Risk reduction']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2024.107848,1,True
International Journal Of Epidemiology,2021,HOSTED-England's household transmission evaluation dataset: Preliminary findings from a novel passive surveillance system of COVID-19,"Background: Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an important component of the community spread of the pandemic. Little is known about the factors associated with household transmission, at the level of the case, contact or household, or how these have varied over the course of the pandemic. Methods: The Household Transmission Evaluation Dataset (HOSTED) is a passive surveillance system linking laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases to individuals living in the same household in England. We explored the risk of household transmission according to: age of case and contact, sex, region, deprivation, month and household composition between April and September 2020, building a multivariate model. Results: In the period studied, on average, 5.5% of household contacts in England were diagnosed as cases. Household transmission was most common between adult cases and contacts of a similar age. There was some evidence of lower transmission rates to under-16s [adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.74). There were clear regional differences, with higher rates of household transmission in the north of England and the Midlands. Less deprived areas had a lower risk of household transmission. After controlling for region, there was no effect of deprivation, but houses of multiple occupancy had lower rates of household transmission [aOR 0.74 (0.66-0.83)]. Conclusions: Children are less likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 via household transmission, and consequently there was no difference in the risk of transmission in households with children. Households in which cases could isolate effectively, such as houses of multiple occupancy, had lower rates of household transmission. Policies to support the effective isolation of cases from their household contacts could lower the level of household transmission.","['Household transmission', 'Passive surveillance', 'SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19']",10.1093/ije/dyab057,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2020,The effect of welfare reform on the health of the unemployed: Evidence from a natural experiment in Germany,"Background Over the past several decades, governments have enacted far-reaching reforms aimed at reducing the generosity and coverage of welfare benefits. Prior literature suggests that these policy measures may have deleterious effects on the health of populations. In this study, we evaluate the impact of one of the largest welfare reforms in recent history-the 2005 Hartz IV reform in Germany-with a focus on estimating its effect on the health of the unemployed. Methods We employed a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences (DID) design using population-based data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, covering the period between 1994 and 2016. We applied DID linear probability modelling to examine the association between the Hartz IV reform and poor self-rated health, adjusting for a range of demographic and socioeconomic confounders. Results The Hartz IV reform was associated with a 3.6 (95% CI 0.9 to 6.2) percentage point increase in the prevalence of poor self-rated health among unemployed persons affected by the reform relative to similar but unaffected controls. This negative association appeared immediately following the implementation of the reform and has persisted over time. Conclusion Governments in numerous European and North American jurisdictions have introduced measures to further diminish the generosity and coverage of welfare benefits. In line with growing concerns over the potential consequences of austerity and associated policy measures, our findings suggest that these reform efforts pose a threat to the health of socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.","['health inequalities', 'policy', 'self-rated health', 'social epidemiology', 'socio-economic']",10.1136/jech-2019-213151,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2023,Urban-rural health disparities in Brazil: Do sociodemographic attributes play a role?,"The debate over urban-rural health disparities in Latin American countries is disputed, and this relationship may not be as straightforward as initially thought. In this study, we investigate whether individual-level self-rated health (SRH) varies across urban and rural populations in the country and how sociodemographic attributes are associated with such differences. We relied on data from the Brazilian National Health Survey (n = 78,806), a nationwide household-based survey conducted in 2019 that is representative of Brazil, geopolitical macro-regions, states, and 27 state capitals. Logistic regression models were used to test for differences in SRH between urban and rural inhabitants. The findings suggest that Brazilian adults living in rural areas are at a higher risk of perceiving their health as poor than their urban counterparts. The urban-rural health disparities are significant and influenced by sociodemographic attributes, highlighting the importance of developing public health interventions to improve health outcomes in these populations.","['Brazil', 'National Health Survey', 'Self-rated health', 'Sociodemographic attributes', 'Urban-rural health disparities']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2023.107679,1,True
American Journal Of Public Health,2021,"Blood donation and COVID-19: Reconsidering the 3-month deferral policy for gay, bisexual, transgender, and other men who have sex with men","In April 2020, in light of COVID-19-related blood shortages, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reduced the deferral period for men who have sex with men (MSM) from its previous duration of 1 year to 3 months. Although originally born out of necessity, the decades-old restrictions on MSM donors have been mitigated by significant advancements in HIV screening, treatment, and public education. The severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic - and the urgent need for safe blood products to respond to such crises - demands an immediate reconsideration of the 3-month deferral policy for MSM. We review historical HIV testing and transmission evidence, discuss the ethical ramifications of the current deferral period, and examine the issue of noncompliance with donor deferral rules. We also propose an eligibility screening format that involves an individual risk-based screening protocol and, unlike current FDA guidelines, does not effectively exclude donors on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. Our policy proposal would allow historically marginalized community members to participate with dignity in the blood donation process without compromising blood donation and transfusion safety outcomes.

In this study, we estimate the prevalence and reasons for forgoing healthcare during the pandemic in Geneva, Switzerland; a country with a universal and mandatory private health insurance coverage. Methods: Participants from a randomly selected population-based sample of the adult population living in the Canton of Geneva completed an online socio-demographic and lifestyle questionnaire between November 2020 and January 2021. The prevalence and reasons for forgoing healthcare since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic were examined descriptively, and logistic regression models were used to assess determinants for forgoing healthcare. Results: The study included 5397 participants, among which 8.0% reported having forgone healthcare since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic; participants with a disadvantaged financial situation (OR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.56–2.65), and those reporting an average (OR = 2.54; 95% CI: 1.94–3.31) or poor health (OR = 4.40; 95% CI: 2.39–7.67) were more likely to forgo healthcare. The most common reasons to forgo healthcare were appointment cancellations by healthcare providers (53.9%), fear of infection (35.3%), and personal organizational issues (11.1%). Conclusion: Our paper highlights the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to healthcare and identifies population sub-groups at-risk for forgoing healthcare. These results necessitate public health efforts to ensure equitable and accessible healthcare as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","['Access to healthcare', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Forgoing healthcare', 'Health equity']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.106987,1,True
American Journal Of Public Health,2020,"Unmet social needs and adherence to pediatric weight management interventions: Massachusetts, 2017–2019","Objectives. To examine effects of unmet social needs on adherence to pediatric weight management intervention (PWMI). Methods. We examined individual associations of positive screens for parental stress, parental depression, food insecurity, and housing insecurity with intervention adherence, and associations of 0, 1 or 2, and 3 or 4 unmet social needs with adherence, among children enrolled in a 2017–2019 comparative effectiveness trial for 2 high-intensity PWMIs in Massachusetts. Models were adjusted for child age, body mass index (BMI), parent BMI, and intervention arm. Results. Families with versus without housing insecurity received a mean of 5.3 (SD = 8.0) versus 8.3 (SD = 10.9) contact hours (P < .01). There were no statistically significant differences in adherence for families reporting other unmet social needs. Children with 3 to 4 unmet social needs versus without received a mean of 5.2 (SD = 8.1) versus 9.2 (SD = 11.8) contact hours (P < .01). In fully adjusted models, those with housing insecurity attended a mean difference of –3.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] = –5.41, –0.88) hours versus those without. Those with 3 or 4 unmet social needs attended –3.74 (95% CI = –6.64, –0.84) hours less than those with none. Conclusions. Adherence to PWMIs was lower among children with housing insecurity and in families with 3 or 4 unmet social needs.

American Journal Of Public Health,2022,"Trends and Variation in the Gap between Current and Anticipated Life Satisfaction in the United States, 2008–2020","Objectives. To describe national- and county-level trends and variation in a novel measure of hope. Methods. Using data from the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index (n 5 2 766 728), we summarized the difference between anticipated life satisfaction (ALS) and current life satisfaction (CLS), measured by the Cantril Self-Anchoring Scale, for each year from 2008 to 2020 and by county over two 5-year periods in the United States. Results. Across all years, there was a significant positive trend in the difference between ALS and CLS for the nation (P 5 .024), which remained positive but not significant when we excluded 2020. Maintenance of ALS with a decrease in CLS drove the 2020 increase. From 2008–2012 to 2013–2017, 14.5% of counties with 300 or more responses (n 5 599) experienced an increase in the difference of more than 1 SD, whereas 13.9% experienced a more than 1 SD decrease.

The Lancet Public Health,2023,Prevalence and variability of depressive symptoms in Europe: update using representative data from the second and third waves of the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS-2 and EHIS-3),"Background: Assessing the prevalence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms and their possible variation by country and over time could be a valuable resource to inform the development of public health policies and preventive resources to reduce mental health burden. We aimed to assess cross-national differences in the point prevalence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms in Europe in 2018–20, and to evaluate point prevalence differences between countries and over time between 2013–15 and 2018–20. Methods: In this population-based study, data from participants in the second and third waves of the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS-2 from 2013 to 2015 and EHIS-3 from 2018 to 2020) from 30 European countries were used (n=542 580). From the total sample, 283 692 participants belonging to EHIS-3 were included in the study (52·4% women and 47·5% men). The non-response in EHIS-3 ranged by country, from 12% to 78%. Point prevalence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms was evaluated using a cutoff score of 10 or more for the 8-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire. Crude prevalence ratios and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) were obtained to assess differences in the prevalence between countries and over time within countries. Findings: The point prevalence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms in Europe in 2018–20 was 6·54% (95% CI 6·34–6·73), ranging across countries from 1·85% (1·53–2·17) in Greece to 10·72% (10·04–11·40) in Sweden. Compared with the other European countries, those with the lowest aPRs were Greece, Serbia, and Cyprus and those with the highest aPRs were Belgium, Slovenia, and Croatia. A small but significant increase in the prevalence between EHIS-2 and EHIS-3 was observed (aPR 1·11 [1·07–1·14]). A wide variability over time in the point prevalence within countries was observed, ranging from an aPR of 0·63 (0·54–0·74) in Hungary to 1·88 (1·53–2·31) in Slovenia. Interpretation: This study, based on large and representative datasets and a valid and reliable screening tool for the assessment of depression, indicates that the point prevalence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms in Europe from 2013 to 2020 remains relatively stable, with wide variability between countries. These findings could be considered a baseline for monitoring the prevalence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms in Europe, and could inform policy for the development of preventive strategies for depression both at a country and European level.

Preventive Medicine,2021,Tobacco product use and susceptibility to use among sexual minority and heterosexual adolescents,"Sexual identity is associated with tobacco use in adults. We examined tobacco use and susceptibility to use by sexual identity in adolescents. Data were collected in February 2019 via Qualtrics research participant panels. Data analyses were performed in June 2019 and updated in October 2020. Respondents aged 13–17 reported sexual identity (heterosexual vs. sexual minority [lesbian, gay, bisexual, or other]), past-month and lifetime tobacco product use, susceptibility to e-cigarette use, friend(s)’ e-cigarette use, tobacco marketing exposure, and demographic characteristics. The sample (n=983) was 72.9% female, 46.5% non-Hispanic white, and 26.1% sexual minority with a mean age of 15.0 years (SD=1.4). Sexual minority adolescents were more likely to have friend(s) who vape (53.0% versus 42.0%; p=0.003). In adjusted models, sexual minority adolescents had greater odds of ever smoking tobacco (odds ratio [OR]=2.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42–2.98) or using e-cigarettes (OR=1.55; 95% CI: 1.08–2.25) relative to heterosexual adolescents. Past-month tobacco smoking and e-cigarette use did not differ by sexual identity. Among participants who had never used tobacco products, sexual minority adolescents reported greater susceptibility to e-cigarette use (OR=1.62; 95% CI: 1.04–2.52) compared to heterosexual adolescents. Exposure to cigarette and e-cigarette marketing, e-cigarette use by friends, and respondent sex were significant covariates in all models. The current findings indicate greater susceptibility to use e-cigarettes and greater tobacco product initiation, but not continuation, among sexual minority adolescents. Sexual minority-tailored interventions may be warranted to prevent tobacco product initiation. Worth exploring are the associations between sexual identity, tobacco marketing exposure, and friend(s)’ e-cigarette use.","['Adolescent', 'E-cigarette', 'Sexual minority', 'Tobacco', 'Vape']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106384,1,True

Cox proportional hazard models showed that Blacks had a higher mortality rate relative to Whites and higher levels of flourishing were associated with a lower mortality rate. Furthermore, a significant interaction between flourishing and race in predicting death was observed. Blacks with higher levels of flourishing had a mortality rate that was not significantly different from that of Whites. However, Blacks, but not Whites, with low flourishing scores had a higher mortality rate. As such, health-promotion efforts focused on enhancing flourishing among Black populations may reduce the Black-White gap in mortalityrate.","['death', 'flourishing', 'health disparities', 'race']",10.1093/aje/kwab067,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2024,Adverse Childhood Experiences and BMI: Lifecourse Associations in a Black–White U.S. Women Cohort,"Introduction: Although adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been positively associated with adiposity, few studies have examined long-term race-specific ACE–BMI relationships. Methods: A Black and White all-women cohort (N=611; 48.6% Black) was followed between 1987 and 1997 from childhood (ages 9–10 years) through adolescence (ages 19–20 years) to midlife (ages 36–43 years, between 2015 and 2019). In these 2020–2022 analyses, the interaction between race and individual ACE exposures (physical abuse, sexual abuse, household substance abuse, multiple ACEs) on continuous BMI at ages 19–20 years and midlife was evaluated individually through multivariable linear regression models. Stratification by race followed as warranted at α=0.15. Results: Race only modified ACE–BMI associations for sexual abuse. Among Black women, sexual abuse was significantly associated with BMI (Badjusted=3.24, 95% CI=0.92, 5.57) at ages 19–20 years and marginally associated at midlife (Badjusted=2.37, 95% CI= −0.62, 5.35); among White women, corresponding associations were null. Overall, having ≥2 ACEs was significantly associated with adolescent BMI (Badjusted=1.47, 95% CI=0.13, 2.80) and was marginally associated at midlife (Badjusted=1.45, 95% CI= −0.31, 3.22). This was similarly observed for physical abuse (adolescent BMI: Badjusted=1.23, 95% CI= −0.08, 2.54; midlife BMI: Badjusted=1.03, 95% CI= −0.71, 2.78), but not for substance abuse. Conclusions: Direct exposure to certain severe ACEs is associated with increased BMI among Black and White women. It is important to consider race, ACE type, and life stage to gain a more sophisticated understanding of ACE–BMI relationships. This knowledge can help strengthen intervention, prevention, and policy efforts aiming to mitigate the impacts of social adversities and trauma on persistent cardiometabolic health disparities over the lifecourse.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2023.09.004,1,True

Methods. In March 2021, we conducted focus groups with members of the Los Angeles, California LGBTQIA community to identify barriers to becoming vaccinated. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 32 individuals in 5 focus groups. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes. Results. Historical and ongoing medical trauma, including misgendering, and perceived emotional violence emerged as significant barriers to LGBTQIA individuals becoming vaccinated. Fear of violence was found to be a major barrier among transgender individuals, whereas fear of an unwelcoming vaccination site was a barrier for seniors. Finally, surviving was a higher priority than becoming vaccinated. Conclusions. Participants reported vaccine hesitancy and barriers that are unique to the life experiences of LGBTQIA individuals; these include medical trauma, violence, stigma, and discrimination.

American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2021,Understanding the Correlates of Firearm Violence Involvement Among Young Adults Experiencing Homelessness: A 7-City Study,"Introduction: Young adults experiencing homelessness are vulnerable to firearm violence. This study aims to explore the correlates of firearm violence involvement among this vulnerable population, which may inform firearm violence reduction intervention development. Methods: Between 2016 and 2017, young adults experiencing homelessness aged 18–26 years (N=1,426) were recruited in 7 U.S. cities. Respondents completed a self-administered computer-assisted anonymous survey regarding their homeless experiences and violence involvement. Separate multivariate logistic regression models were conducted in 2020 to explore the correlates of direct firearm violence victimization, witness of firearm violence, and firearm violence perpetration. Results: A high proportion of young adults experiencing homelessness were involved in firearm violence (witnessing firearm violence: 40%; direct firearm violence victimization: 28%; perpetration: 18%). Stressful experiences, such as childhood trauma and street victimization, were associated with greater odds of firearm violence involvement. Black (OR=2.4, p<0.001) and Latinx (OR=2.0, p<0.05) young adults had greater odds of experiencing direct firearm violence victimization than White young adults. Black (OR=2.0, p<0.01) and Latinx (OR=2.4, p<0.001) young adults were also at greater risk of witnessing firearm violence. Young adults with mental illness had greater odds of being directly victimized by firearm violence (OR=1.7, p<0.01). Conclusions: Given the inter-related nature of firearm violence involvement and given that risk factors for violence are often embedded in social and structural contexts, multipronged community-based approaches to prevent firearm violence among young adults experiencing homelessness are necessary. Targeted efforts may be indicated to attenuate the risk and promote resilience among subgroups of young adults experiencing homelessness who are disproportionately affected by firearm violence.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2021.02.016,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2023,"The need for a personalized, core digital resource to facilitate health self-management","High quality healthcare is becoming increasingly unaffordable and inaccessible. To reverse this trend, people need to self-manage as much of their health as possible. They need to take appropriate preventive actions and use health services in a timely and efficient manner. Yet health self-management is challenging in an increasingly complex environment that involves competing demands and sometimes contradictory advice as well as increasingly fragmented delivery of health services. Digital tools have added a new dimension to healthcare and hold the potential to help bridge these challenges. Unfortunately, much of the potential benefit of digital resources is not being realized, partly because of difficulties people face in identifying appropriate and effective resources in a haystack of mainly unevaluated and often poorly conceived resources. Underuse and failure to maintain use of resources found to be effective also retards progress. Furthermore, people need more help to understand their needs and establish priorities around their health self-management. We argue that these needs can be met with a person-centered, digital self-management core resource that supports people to better understand their needs and priorities and has links to find the resources they need to manage their health, alone or by judicious use of health services.","['Digital technology', 'Health services', 'Preventive medicine', 'Public health', 'Risk assessment', 'Self-management', 'Social medicine', 'Telemedicine']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2023.107569,1,True
American Journal Of Public Health,2023,Integrating Racism as a Sentinel Indicator in Public Health Surveillance and Monitoring Systems,"Objectives. To evaluate public health surveillance and monitoring systems’ (PHSMS) efforts to collect, monitor, track, and analyze racism. Methods. We employed an environmental scan approach. We defined key questions and data to be collected, conducted a literature review, and synthesized the results by using a qualitative description approach. Results. We identified 125 PHSMS; only 3—the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System, and California Health Interview Survey—collected and reported data on individual-level racism. Structural racism was not collected in PHSMS; however, we observed evidence for linkages to census and administrative data sets or social media sources to assess structural racism. Conclusions. There is a paucity of PHSMS that measure individual-level racism, and few systems are linked to structural racism measures. Public Health Implications. Adopting a standard practice of racism surveillance can advance equity-centered public health praxis, inform policy, and foster greater accountability among public health practitioners, researchers, and decision-makers. Failure to explicitly address racism and the insufficient capacity to support a robust health equity data infrastructure severely impedes efforts to address and dismantle systemic racism.",[],10.2105/AJPH.2022.307160,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2024,Medical occupational check-ups during the COVID-19 pandemic in the European Union,"Given the enormous scale of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the healthcare sector, limited human resource capacity, and efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, occupational health protection could not escape changes. The aim was to identify and compare the regulations regarding the provision of medical occupational check-ups (MOCs) during the pandemic in all European Union member states (EU MS). The study employed the Delphi method, involving experts from EU MS to assess MOC regulations between January 2020 and May 2021. Experts were queried regarding the existence and specifics of MOC regulations, particularly for entrance and periodic MOCs at hazardous and non-hazardous workplaces. Out of the 27 EU MS surveyed, 13 EU MS did not regulate MOCs, while 14 EU MS (51.6%) regulated the provision of MOCs. The regulations were changes in the way MOCs were provided, modifications (postponement in time, alternative provision, e.g. using telemedicine or online connection, or replacing the medical certificate of fitness to work based on the MOC with a declaration by the worker), or interruption without compensation, even for hazardous works. The regulations were in effect for different lengths of time and varied in some countries during the study period. The cumulative duration of MOC interruptions in all EU MS during the study period was 137 months (7.5% of the cumulative study period of 1836 months). Given the different approaches to the provision of MOCs in EU MS, it has proved appropriate to develop an optimal unified framework plan for future similar situations.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckae103,1,True
International Journal Of Epidemiology,2024,Early developments of psychiatric epidemiology in Chile: a local history with global implications,"This viewpoint discusses a conference paper titled: “Epidemiological research on mental morbidity in Chile”, which summarizes a handful of studies from 1950s in Chile covering conditions such as alcoholism, psychosis, epilepsy, and neurosis. These were the first psychiatric epidemiological population studies conducted in the Southern hemisphere, but they are largely unknown globally. We argue that the Chilean studies have important implications for modern psychiatric epidemiology, as well as for related fields such as global mental health and mental health services research. This piece starts by describing the general sociopolitical context and presenting the main methodological features of the studies. It focuses then on three specific implications for the field: 1) promoting decoloniality in psychiatric epidemiology; 2) ensuring methodological rigor and feasibility; and 3) informing the development of mental health policy and services.","['Decoloniality', 'Global Mental Health', 'Latin America', 'Psychiatric Epidemiology']",10.1093/ije/dyae026,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2021,"Association between early treatment hospitals, serum cholesterol level and cardiovascular disease risk in dyslipidemia patients","Background: Studies have shown the importance of managing chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), at the primary treatment level. Here, we aimed to evaluate the association between medical treatment institutions and health outcomes in patients with dyslipidemia, a major risk of CVD, to provide evidence for increasing chronic disease management at the primary care level in Korea. Methods: We used National Health Insurance Sampling cohort data, of which 37 506 patients were newly diagnosed with dyslipidemia during 2009-14. CVD risk and changes in serum cholesterol level after dyslipidemia diagnosis were outcome variable examined. A generalized estimating equation model was used to identify associations between initial medical institution, CVD risk and changes in serum cholesterol levels. The Cox proportional-hazard ratio was used to assess the association between initial medical institutions and detailed CVD risk. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess CVD risk following treatment with prescription medication. Results: Our analyses demonstrate that CVD risk was lower at primary care-level community health centers and clinics compared to tertiary hospitals, with a statistically significant difference observed in clinics. Ischemic heart disease was lower at community health centers and clinics. However, all medical institution types were associated with significantly lower serum cholesterol levels compared to the baseline. Conclusions: Management of patients with dyslipidemia at primary care institutions was associated with reduced CVD risk and decreased serum cholesterol levels. Therefore, policymakers should strengthen the quality of healthcare at primary care institutions and educate patients that these institutions are appropriate for managing chronic disease.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckaa139,1,True

The objective of this study was to estimate the sustained effects of two interventions to improve financial access to facility-based deliveries. Methods In an innovative controlled interrupted time-series study with primary data, we used four non-equivalent dependent variables (antenatal care) as control outcomes to estimate the effects of a national subsidy for deliveries (January 2007-December 2013) and a local 'free delivery' intervention (June 2007-December 2010) on facility-based deliveries. The statistical analysis used spline linear regressions with random intercepts and slopes. Results The analysis involved 20 877 observations for the national subsidy and 8842 for the 'free delivery' intervention. The two interventions did not have immediate effects. However, both were associated with positive trend changes varying from 0.21 to 0.52 deliveries per month during the first 12 months and from 0.78 to 2.39 deliveries per month during the first 6 months. The absolute effects, evaluated 84 and 42 months after introduction, ranged from 2.64 (95% CI 0.51 to 4.77) to 10.78 (95% CI 8.52 to 13.03) and from 9.57 (95% CI 5.97 to 13.18) to 14.47 (95% CI 10.47 to 18.47) deliveries per month for the national subsidy and the 'free delivery' intervention, respectively, depending on the type of antenatal care used as a control outcome. Conclusion The results suggest that both interventions were associated with sustained non-linear increases in facility-based deliveries. The use of multiple control groups strengthens the credibility of the results, making them useful for policy makers seeking solutions for universal health coverage.","['EPIDEMIOLOGY', 'HEALTH POLICY', 'PUBLIC HEALTH', 'STUDY DESIGN']",10.1136/jech-2022-218794,1,True

To measure rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) screening during the perinatal period among people experiencing physical violence in the United States. Methods. We used 2016–2019 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data (n 5 158 338) to describe the incidence of physical IPV before or during pregnancy. We then assessed the prevalence of IPV screening before, during, or after pregnancy and predictors of receiving screening among those reporting violence. Results. Among the 3.5% (n 5 6259) of respondents experiencing violence, 58.7%, 26.9%, and 48.3% were not screened before, during, or after pregnancy, respectively. Those reporting Medicaid or no insurance at birth, American Indian/Alaska Native people, and Spanish-speaking Hispanic people faced increased risk of not having a health care visit during which screening might occur. Among those attending a health care visit, privately insured people, rural residents, and non-Hispanic White respondents faced increased risk of not being screened. Conclusions. Among birthing people reporting physical IPV, nearly half were not screened for IPV before or after pregnancy.

Preventive Medicine,2021,"Incongruency of youth food and physical activity environments in the United States: Variations by region, rurality, and income","Local environments are increasingly the focus of health behavior research and practice to reduce gaps between fruit/vegetable intake, physical activity (PA), and related guidelines. This study examined the congruency between youth food and PA environments and differences by region, rurality, and income across the United States. Food and PA environment data were obtained for all U.S. counties (N = 3142) using publicly available, secondary sources. Relationships between the food and PA environment tertiles was represented using five categories: 1) congruent–low (county falls in both the low food and PA tertiles), 2) congruent–high (county falls in both the high food and PA tertiles), 3) incongruent–food high/PA low (county falls in high food and low PA tertiles), 4) incongruent–food low/PA high (county falls in low food and high PA tertiles), and 5) intermediate food or PA (county falls in the intermediate tertile for food and/or PA). Results showed disparities in food and PA environment congruency according to region, rurality, and income (p < .0001 for each). Nearly 25% of counties had incongruent food and PA environments, with food high/PA low counties mostly in rural and low-income areas, and food low/PA high counties mostly in metropolitan and high-income areas. Approximately 8.7% of counties were considered congruent–high and were mostly located in the Northeast, metropolitan, and high-income areas. Congruent–low counties made up 10.0% of counties and were mostly in the South, rural, and low-income areas. National and regional disparities in environmental obesity determinants were identified that can inform targeted public health interventions.","['Congruency', 'Disparities', 'Food environment', 'Obesity', 'Physical activity environment', 'Youth']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106594,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2023,Could diabetes prevention programmes result in the widening of sociodemographic inequalities in type 2 diabetes? Comparison of survey and administrative data for England,"Background The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme (DPP) in England is a behavioural intervention for preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among people with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (NDH). How this programme affects inequalities by age, sex, limiting illnesses or disability, ethnicity or deprivation is not known. Methods We used multinomial and binary logistic regression models to compare whether the population with NDH at different stages of the programme are representative of the population with NDH: stages include (1) prevalence of NDH (using survey data from UK Household Longitudinal Study (n=794) and Health Survey for England (n=1383)); (2) identification in primary care and offer of programme (using administrative data from the National Diabetes Audit (n=1 267 350)) and (3) programme participation (using programme provider records (n=98 024)). Results Predicted probabilities drawn from the regressions with demographics as each outcome and dataset identifier as predictors showed that younger adults (aged under 40) (4% of the population with NDH (95% CI 2.4% to 6.5%)) and older adults (aged 80 and above) (12% (95% CI 9.5% to 14.2%)) were slightly under-represented among programme participants (2% (95% CI 1.8% to 2.2%) and 8% (95% CI 7.8% to 8.2%) of programme participants, respectively). People living in deprived areas were under-represented in eight sessions (14% (95% CI 13.7% to 14.4%) vs 20% (95% CI 16.4% to 23.6%) in the general population). Ethnic minorities were over-represented among offers (35% (95% CI 35.1% to 35.6%) vs 13% (95% CI 9.1% to 16.4%) in general population), though the proportion dropped at the programme completion stage (19% (95% CI 18.5% to 19.5%)). Conclusion The DPP has the potential to reduce ethnic inequalities, but may widen socioeconomic, age and limiting illness or disability-related inequalities in T2DM. While ethnic minority groups are over-represented at the identification and offer stages, efforts are required to support completion of the programme. Programme providers should target under-represented groups to ensure equitable access and narrow inequalities in T2DM.","['diabetes mellitus', 'health inequalities', 'prevention', 'primary health care']",10.1136/jech-2022-219654,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2022,"Self-perception of health and physical activity among adults before and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: United States, 2019–2020","The compounded impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns on self-perception of health (SPoH) and physical activity (PA) levels among U.S. adults remains to be explored. We sought to: (1) describe the SPoH and PA levels among U.S. adults; (2) explore the relationship between SPoH and PA before and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data from the 2019 and 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th, 2020. This date was chosen to demarcate the responses as before and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Weighted prevalence estimates were presented alongside adjusted odds ratios from multivariable logistic regression of general SPoH and PA levels for U.S. adults before and amidst COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data for 9328 participants. Over half of the U.S. adult population reported performing no muscle strengthening exercise in 2019. The number of inactive people has slightly increased in 2020 (27.8%), compared to 2019 (26.5%). Overall, levels of PA for active people were comparable in 2020 pre and post the WHO pandemic declaration date (36.4% and 39.8%; respectively). Higher odds of negative SPoH were observed among black individuals, current cigarettes smokers, with annual income less than $35,000, physically inactive individuals, people who do not perform muscle-strengthening exercise, and who were very obese. Negative SPoH were associated with lack of moderate exercise, and lack of muscle-strengthening training among U.S. adults before and amidst the pandemic. Pandemic policies and recommendations should include and facilitate PA, specifically among vulnerable populations.","['COVID-19', 'Diagnostic self evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Health perception', 'Pandemic', 'Physical activity', 'Self concept']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107037,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2022,The experience of secondary traumatic stress among community violence interventionists in Chicago,"Community violence intervention strategies are rising in prominence as promising alternatives to traditional criminal justice responses to gun violence. Although such approaches may offer policy advantages and yield societal benefits, the costs to the practitioners of this work—owing to the intimate proximity to violence required by the job—have generally been overlooked. Using a first of its kind survey of nearly the entire population of community-based violence interventionists in Chicago, Illinois (United States), this study assesses the extent to which violence intervention workers experience Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS). Responses to a series of 17 items on a Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale revealed alarmingly high levels of STS among violence interventionists: 94% of workers reported at least one STS indicator in the past 7 days and a full 50% reported experiencing 9 out of the 17 STS items. Our analysis further showed that the STS responses of interventionists were impacted by on-the-job traumatic experiences, particularly the death of a client. These results offer an important first systematic analysis of the trauma and mental health risks associated with community violence intervention practice and suggest that policymakers and practitioners should monitor and address worker risk of traumatic stress within this important public health profession.","['Community violence intervention', 'Gun violence', 'Secondary traumatic stress', 'Violence policy']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107186,1,True

There is limited evidence on the acute effects of air pollution on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: From 2014 to 2019, we collected data on daily admissions for COPD patients from a city in China. We used the generalized additive model together with distributed lag models to fit the associations of air pollutants with hospital admissions. Results: We observed significant increments in the number of daily admissions (0.086–0.109%) for COPD for a unit range increase in air quality index, PM2:5 and PM10 over four lag days. The impact of air pollution on the number of daily admissions was mainly reflected in the COPD patients who were hospitalized through outpatient departments and tertiary hospitals. Discussion: Short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution may induce the occurrence or exacerbation of COPD patients; therefore, government departments should strengthen the management of air pollution, improve supervision and control mechanisms, pay attention to the quality of medical services, and reduce the adverse effects of air pollution on patients’ health.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckad199,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2020,Reducing Both Food Insecurity and Excess Body Weight in Costa Rican Women: A Cluster Randomized Trial,"Introduction: The coexistence of food insecurity and excess body weight has been well documented in women. Both food insecurity and excess body weight have multiple consequences for physical and mental health. Concerns have been raised about interventions aimed to reduce food insecurity because these interventions might contribute to excess body weight, particularly in adult women. The purpose of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention to simultaneously reduce food insecurity and body weight through alleviating discouragement—which women described as feeling sad, depressed, hopeless, and lacking drive to do important activities, such as finding a job or studying more—by increasing women's empowerment. Study design: This 2-armed cluster RCT was conducted from February to December 2017. Data were analyzed from January to July 2018. Setting/participants: Participants were food-insecure women with excess body weight in the Central Canton of the province of Alajuela, Costa Rica. Intervention: The intensive intervention arm consisted of activities at the individual (12 sessions lasting 2 hours each, 3 follow-up monthly sessions, and 1 closing session), household (1 workshop with the participants’ household and community members and homework with family participation), and community (2 brochures and 1 workshop) levels. The nonintensive control arm consisted of 3 sessions about healthy lifestyles lasting 1 hour each. Main outcome measures: Outcome measures included BMI, waist circumference, and food insecurity. Results: A total of 171 participants were enrolled (83 in intensive and 88 in nonintensive control arms). At 6 months, the intensive arm had greater decreases from baseline in BMI (−0.648, p=0.019), waist circumference (−2.21, p=0.002), and food insecurity (−1.35, p=0.009) compared with the nonintensive control arm. Conclusions: The intensive intervention was effective in simultaneously reducing food insecurity and excess body weight. Educational components should be added to interventions aimed to reduce food insecurity.

American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2020,"Violence Victimization, Substance Use Disparities, and Gender-Nonconforming Youth","Introduction: Exposure to violence victimization may help explain disparities of substance use among gender-nonconforming youth (i.e., those whose gender expression differs from societal expectations). Methods: In 2015, three large urban school districts (2 in California and 1 in Florida) conducted a Youth Risk Behavior Survey that included the assessment of gender expression among a racially/ethnically diverse population-based sample of 6,082 high school students. Five categories of violence victimization were assessed (felt unsafe at school, threatened or injured with a weapon at school, bullied at school, electronically bullied, and forced sexual intercourse). In 2019, the effect of violence victimization on substance use disparities was examined by calculating sex-stratified prevalence ratios by gender nonconformity, adjusted for sexual identity, race/ethnicity, and grade (adjusted prevalence ratio 1 [APR1]), and comparing these with prevalence ratios adjusted for those variables plus violence victimization (adjusted prevalence ratio 2 [APR2]). Results: Among female students, only being threatened or injured with a weapon was significantly (p<0.05) associated with gender nonconformity and there were no substance use disparities by gender nonconformity. Among male students, every category of violence victimization was more prevalent among gender-nonconforming than among gender-conforming students and most substance use categories demonstrated significant gender nonconformity disparities. After controlling for violence victimization, these disparities decreased but remained statistically significant for the use of cocaine (APR1=2.84 vs APR2=1.99), methamphetamine (APR1=4.47 vs APR2=2.86), heroin (APR1=4.55 vs APR2=2.96), and injection drug use (APR1=7.90 vs APR2=4.72). Conclusions: School-based substance use prevention programs may benefit from strategies that support gender diversity and reduce violence victimizations experienced by gender-nonconforming students, by providing a safe and supportive school environment.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2019.12.021,1,True
American Journal Of Epidemiology,2024,"Daily heat and mortality among people experiencing homelessness in 2 urban US counties, 2015-2022","High and low daily ambient temperatures are associated with higher mortality in the general population. People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are thought to be particularly vulnerable, but there is almost no direct evidence available. We examined the temperature-mortality association among PEH in 2 populous, urban counties in hot-climate regions of the United States, focusing on heat effects. Study setting was Los Angeles County, CA, and Clark County, NV, which encompass the cities of Los Angeles and Las Vegas, respectively. Outcomes were 2015-2022 deaths among decedents categorized as homeless in county administrative records. We used quasi-Poisson distributed lag nonlinear models to estimate the association of mortality with daily temperatures and with 7-day lagged temperatures, adjusting for day of week, seasonality, and long-term trends. We estimated the minimum mortality temperature and fraction of mortality attributable to temperatures above and below minimum mortality temperature. The association between daily temperature and PEH mortality was skewed towards greater risk at higher temperatures, especially in Clark County. Temperature-attributable mortality equaled 50.1% of deaths in Clark County (95% CI, 29.0-62.8) and 7.0% in Los Angeles County (95% CI, 1.4-12.1). In both counties, most temperature-attributable deaths were attributable to heat rather than cold. In these hot-climate urban counties, our estimates of heat-attributable mortality among PEH were orders of magnitude greater than those reported in prior research on the general population. These results indicate that temperature vulnerability, particularly heat vulnerability, requires stronger public health and policy responses.

Preventive Medicine,2022,Improving the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ employees: Do workplace diversity training and ally networks make a difference?,"Despite growing recognition that lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and other minority (LGBTQ+) employees have lower levels of workplace wellbeing than cis-gender heterosexual employees, few studies have examined how different workplace interventions may mitigate these disparities. This study provides first-time evidence of associations between LGBTQ+ employee wellbeing and two types of initiatives that have received substantial public attention and employer uptake: workplace gender and sexuality diversity training and ally (or employee) networks. To accomplish this, the analyses leverage Australian data from a unique, national employer-employee survey of workplace inclusion (2020 Australian Workplace Equality Index Employee Survey; n = 31,277). These data were used to derive individual- as well as organizational-level measures of diversity training and ally behaviors, and to estimate their associations with a multidimensional index of LGBTQ+ employee wellbeing using fully adjusted random-intercept multilevel regression models. The results indicated that all individual- and organizational-level measures of workplace diversity training and ally behaviors exhibited positive, large, and statistically significant associations with the LGBTQ+ employee wellbeing index, controlling for an extensive set of confounds and organization-specific random effects. These findings have significant implications for health policy and practice. Specifically, they indicate that diversity training and ally networks may improve wellbeing amongst LGBTQ+ employees. This suggests that employer investments in diversity training and ally networks are effective interventions to enhance workplace culture, employee productivity and intergroup relations.","['Ally networks', 'Diversity training', 'LGBTQ+', 'Wellbeing', 'Workplace']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107113,1,True

It is unknown whether immigration status reduces the likelihood of KT after wait-listing despite universal healthcare coverage with uniform access to transplantation. Methods: We retrospectively collected data of all adult waiting list (WL) registrants in Italy (2010-20) followed for 5 years until death, KT in a foreign center, deceased-donor kidney transplant (DDKT), living-donor kidney transplant (LDKT) or permanent withdrawal from the WL. We calculated adjusted relative probability of DDKT, LDKT and permanent WL withdrawal in different immigrant categories using competing-risks multiple regression models. Results: Patients were European Union (EU)-born (n = 21 624), Eastern European-born (n = 606) and non-European-born (n = 1944). After controlling for age, sex, blood type, dialysis vintage, case-mix and sensitization status, non-European-born patients had lower LDKT rates compared to other immigrant categories: LDKT adjusted relative probability of non-European-born vs. Eastern European-born 0.51 (95% CI: 0.33-0.79; P = 0.002); of non-European-born vs. EU-Born: 0.65 (95% CI: 0.47-0.82; P = 0.001). Immigration status did not affect the rate of DDKT or permanent WL withdrawal. Conclusions: Among EU WL registrants, non-European immigration background is associated with reduced likelihood of LDKT but similar likelihood of DDKT and permanent WL withdrawal. Wherever not available, new national policies should enable coverage of travel and medical fees for living-donor surgery and follow-up for non-resident donors to improve uptake of LDKT in immigrant patients, and provide KT education that is culturally competent, individually tailored and easily understandable for patients and their potential living donors.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckac027,1,True

Between 1999 and 2000, we enrolled pregnant women in a birth cohort drawn from an agricultural region of California. We measured dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites of OP pesticides in maternal pregnancy urine samples (13 and 26 weeks) and estimated associations with behaviors related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and executive function, assessed longitudinally; 351 families provided neurodevelopmental outcome data at any point when the child was aged 7-12 years. We assessed function across multiple dimensions (e.g., working memory, attention), methods (e.g., behavior reports, child assessment), and reporters (e.g., mothers, teachers, child self-reports). Higher gestational DAP concentrations were consistently associated with behaviors related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and executive function. For example, a 10-fold increase in gestational DAP concentration was associated with poorer longitudinally assessed Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function scores, as reported by mothers (β = 4.0 (95% confidence interval: 2.1, 5.8); a higher score indicates more problems), and Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition Working Memory scores (a 3.8-point reduction; â=.3.8 (95% confidence interval:.6.2, .1.3)).Reducing gestational exposure to OP pesticides through public health policy is an important goal.","['attention', 'attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder', 'executive function', 'gestational exposure', 'neurodevelopment', 'organophosphate pesticides']",10.1093/aje/kwab173,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2021,Nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and identification of risk factors in the general population of the Netherlands during the first epidemic wave,"Background We aimed to detect SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies in the general population of the Netherlands and identify risk factors for seropositivity amidst the first COVID-19 epidemic wave. Methods Participants (n=3207, aged 2-90 years), enrolled from a previously established nationwide serosurveillance study, provided a self-collected fingerstick blood sample and completed a questionnaire (median inclusion date 3 April 2020). IgG antibodies targeted against the spike S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using a validated multiplex-immunoassay. Seroprevalence was estimated controlling for survey design, individual pre-pandemic concentration, and test performance. Random-effects logistic regression identified risk factors for seropositivity. Results Overall seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), with no differences between sexes or ethnic background, and regionally ranging between 1.3 and 4.0%. Estimates were highest among 18-39 year-olds (4.9%), and lowest in children 2-17 years (1.7%). Multivariable analysis revealed that persons taking immunosuppressants and those from the Orthodox-Reformed Protestant community had over four times higher odds of being seropositive compared to others. Anosmia/ageusia was the most discriminative symptom between seropositive (53%) and seronegative persons (4%, p<0.0001). Antibody concentrations in seropositive persons were significantly higher in those with fever or dyspnoea in contrast to those without (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively). Conclusions In the midst of the first epidemic wave, 2.8% of the Dutch population was estimated to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, that is, 30 times higher than reported. This study identified independent groups with increased odds for seropositivity that may require specific surveillance measures to guide future protective interventions internationally, including vaccination once available.","['Epidemics', 'Epidemiology', 'Infection', 'Public health', 'Surveillance']",10.1136/jech-2020-215678,1,True

To examine the accessibility of hospital facilities with maternity care services in 1 rural county in Alabama in preparation for the initiation of prenatal care services at a federally qualified health center. Methods. We analyzed driving distance (in miles) from maternal city of residence in Conecuh County, Alabama to hospital of delivery, using 2019–2021 vital statistics data and geographic information system (GIS) software. Results. A total of 370 births to mothers who have home addresses in Conecuh County were reported, and 368 of those were in hospital facilities. The majority of deliveries were less than 30 miles (median 5 23 miles) from the maternal city of residence. Some women traveled more than 70 miles for obstetrical care. Conclusions. Pregnant patients in Conecuh County experience significant geographic barriers related to perinatal care access. Using GIS for this analysis is a promising approach to better understand the unique challenges of pregnant individuals in this rural population. Public health policy efforts need to be geographically tailored to address these disparities.",[],10.2105/AJPH.2024.307692,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2022,Limits of prenatal care coordination for improving birth outcomes among Medicaid participants,"Maternity Care Homes (MCHs) intend to address clinical and psychosocial needs for perinatal patients and are commonly implemented for Medicaid beneficiaries. Rigorous evidence supporting MCHs' effectiveness for improving birth outcomes is thin, but most studies consider only clinical and demographic factors from administrative data. To assess birth outcomes with controls for psychosocial variables known to affect them, this paper considers quantitative participant-level data from the Strong Start for Mothers and Newborns prenatal care initiative, with qualitative case study data to further contextualize results. From 2013 to 2017, Strong Start served over 45,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in 32 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico though MCHs, group prenatal care, or freestanding birth centers. Participant data included risks screens for food insecurity, depression, anxiety, pregnancy intention, and intimate partner violence, in addition to clinical and demographic information. After clinical, demographic and psychosocial risks were controlled in a regression model, Strong Start birth center participants showed significantly lower rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, and cesarean section relative to MCH participants (p <.01). In group prenatal care, White participants showed lower rates of preterm birth (p <.01) and Black participants showed lower rates of low birthweight (p <.05) relative to MCH participants. Strong Start participants reported appreciation for MCH care managers' support, but community and clinical referrals often had long waiting lists or were inaccessible. Transformative care models focusing on provider continuity, relationship building, and patient activation may offer more promise for improving birth outcomes than supplementing medical models with care management and other resources.","['Care coordination', 'Cesarean rates', 'Equity', 'Prenatal care', 'Preterm birth']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107240,1,True
International Journal Of Epidemiology,2021,Reducing socio-economic inequalities in all-cause mortality: A counterfactual mediation approach,"Background: Socio-economic inequalities in mortality are well established, yet the contribution of intermediate risk factors that may underlie these relationships remains unclear. We evaluated the role of multiple modifiable intermediate risk factors underlying socio- economic-associated mortality and quantified the potential impact of reducing early allcause mortality by hypothetically altering socio-economic risk factors. Methods: Data were from seven cohort studies participating in the LIFEPATH Consortium (total n 179 090). Using both socio-economic position (SEP) (based on occupation) and education, we estimated the natural direct effect on all-cause mortality and the natural indirect effect via the joint mediating role of smoking, alcohol intake, dietary patterns, physical activity, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated, using counterfactual natural effect models under different hypothetical actions of either lower or higher SEP or education. Results: Lower SEP and education were associated with an increase in all-cause mortality within an average follow-up time of 17.5 years. Mortality was reduced via modelled hypothetical actions of increasing SEP or education. Through higher education, the HR was 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84, 0.86] for women and 0.71 (95% CI 0.70, 0.74) for men, compared with lower education. In addition, 34% and 38% of the effect was jointly mediated for women and men, respectively. The benefits from altering SEP were slightly more modest. Conclusions: These observational findings support policies to reduce mortality both through improving socio-economic circumstances and increasing education, and by altering intermediaries, such as lifestyle behaviours and morbidities.","['All-cause mortality', 'Causal inference', 'Health behaviours', 'Intervention', 'Mediation', 'Multiple mediators', 'Socio-economic inequalities']",10.1093/IJE/DYZ248,1,True
The Lancet Public Health,2024,Temperature-related mortality burden and projected change in 1368 European regions: a modelling study,"Background: Excessively high and low temperatures substantially affect human health. Climate change is expected to exacerbate heat-related morbidity and mortality, presenting unprecedented challenges to public health systems. Since localised assessments of temperature-related mortality risk are essential to formulate effective public health responses and adaptation strategies, we aimed to estimate the current and future temperature-related mortality risk under four climate change scenarios across all European regions. Methods: We modelled current and future mortality due to non-optimal temperatures across 1368 European regions, considering age-specific characteristics and local socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Overseas territories were excluded from the analysis. We applied a three-stage method to estimate temperature-related risk continuously across age and spatial dimensions. Age and city-specific exposure–response functions were obtained for a comprehensive list of 854 European cities from the Urban Audit dataset of Eurostat. Regional aggregates were calculated using an aggregation and extrapolation method that incorporates the risk incidence in neighbouring cities. Mortality was projected for present conditions observed in 1991–2020 and for four different levels of global warming (1·5°C, 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C increase) by regions, and subregions using an ensemble of 11 climate models produced by the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment-CMIP5 over Europe, and population projection data from EUROPOP2019. Findings: Our results highlight regional disparities in temperature-related mortality across Europe. Between 1991 and 2020, the number of cold-related deaths was 2·5 times higher in eastern Europe than western Europe, and heat-related deaths were 6 times higher in southern Europe than in northern Europe. During the same time period, there were a median of 363 809 cold-related deaths (empirical 95% CI 362 493–365 310) and 43 729 heat-related deaths (39 880–45 921), with a cold-to-heat-related death ratio of 8·3:1. Under current climate policies, aligned with 3°C increase in global warming, it is estimated that temperature-related deaths could increase by 54 974 additional deaths (24 112–80 676) by 2100, driven by rising heat-related deaths and an ageing population, resulting in a cold-to-heat-related death ratio of 2·6:1. Climate change is also expected to widen disparities in regional mortality, particularly impacting southern regions of Europe as a result of a marked increase in heat-related deaths. Interpretation: This study shows that regional disparities in temperature-related mortality risk in Europe are substantial and will continue to increase due to the effects of climate change and an ageing population. The data presented can assist policy makers and health authorities in mitigating increasing health inequalities by prioritising the protection of more susceptible areas and older population groups. We identify the projected areas of heightened risk (southern Europe), where policy intervention aimed at building adaptation and enhancing resilience should be prioritised.

American Journal Of Public Health,2021,"State preemption of local immigration ""sanctuary"" policies: Legal considerations","States have enacted a wave of statutes over the past several years preempting local government law and policies that potentially promote public health in various ways. Among these local preemption measures are statutes in at least 9 states that outlaw municipal policies providing some form of ""sanctuary"" to immigrants. Such policies, and their preemption, have importance both for direct access to health services and for broader social determinants of health. This article gauges the coverage and potential impact of these state preemption laws based on key informant interviews nationally and a close legal analysis of relevant laws and policy documents. It distinguishes between preemption laws focused on law enforcement cooperation and those that also encompass a wider array of ""welcoming"" policies and initiatives. It also distinguishes between more passive forms of preemption that prohibit barring cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, and those statutes that more affirmatively require active measures to assist federal enforcement. Drawing these distinctions can help municipalities determine which immigrant-supportive measures are still permitted, and how best to mitigate the adverse public health effects of these preemption laws.

Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2022,Effects of depression on employment and social outcomes: A Mendelian randomisation study,"Background Depression is associated with socioeconomic disadvantage. However, whether and how depression exerts a causal effect on employment remains unclear. We used Mendelian randomisation (MR) to investigate whether depression affects employment and related outcomes in the UK Biobank dataset. Methods We selected 227 242 working-age participants (40-64 in men, 40-59 years for women) of white British ethnicity/ancestry with suitable genetic data in the UK Biobank study. We used 30 independent genetic variants associated with depression as instruments. We conducted observational and two-sample MR analyses. Outcomes were employment status (employed vs not, and employed vs sickness/disability, unemployment, retirement or caring for home/family); weekly hours worked (among employed); Townsend Deprivation Index; highest educational attainment; and household income. Results People who had experienced depression had higher odds of non-employment, sickness/disability, unemployment, caring for home/family and early retirement. Depression was associated with reduced weekly hours worked, lower household income and lower educational attainment, and increased deprivation. MR analyses suggested depression liability caused increased non-employment (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.26) and sickness/disability (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.82), but was not causal for caring for home/family, early retirement or unemployment. There was little evidence from MR that depression affected weekly hours worked, educational attainment, household income or deprivation. Conclusions Depression liability appears to cause increased non-employment, particularly by increasing disability. There was little evidence of depression affecting early retirement, hours worked or household income, but power was low. Effective treatment of depression might have important economic benefits to individuals and society.",['Keywords'],10.1136/jech-2021-218074,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2020,Childhood socio-economic conditions and risk of cardiovascular disease: Results from a pooled sample of 14 011 adults from India,"Background South Asians are at an increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease, but the reasons for this are unclear. Poor socio-economic conditions in childhood are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in many high-income countries and may be particularly relevant to South Asia, where socio-economic deprivation is more prevalent and severe. However, evidence from South Asia is limited. Methods We pooled data from two large population-based studies in India to provide a geographically representative and adequately powered sample of Indian adults. We used multilevel linear regression models to assess associations between standard of living index (SLI) in childhood (measured by recalled household assets at age 10-12 years) and major cardiovascular risk factors including adiposity, blood pressure, and fasting blood lipids, glucose and insulin. Results Data on 14 011 adults (median age 39 years, 56% men) were analysed. SLI in childhood was inversely associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, independent of socio-economic conditions in adulthood, with beta coefficients (95% CIs) of -0.70 mmHg (-1.17 to -0.23) and -0.56 mmHg (-0.91 to -0.22), respectively, per SD increase in SLI in childhood. There was no strong evidence for an association between SLI in childhood and other risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Conclusions Poor socio-economic conditions in childhood may contribute to the increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease among South Asians by raising their blood pressure. Elucidating the mechanisms and improving socio-economic conditions for children in South Asia could provide major reductions in the burden of cardiovascular disease.","['CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE', 'CHRONIC DI', 'LIFECOURSE / CHILDHOOD CIRCUMSTANCES', 'NUTRITION', 'OBESITY', 'PAEDIATRIC', 'SOCIO-ECONOMIC']",10.1136/jech-2020-214016,1,True
International Journal Of Epidemiology,2021,Changes in infection-related hospitalizations in children following pandemic restrictions: An interrupted time-series analysis of total population data,"Background: Infectious diseases are a leading cause of hospitalization during childhood. The various mitigation strategies implemented to control the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic could have additional, unintended benefits for limiting the spread of other infectious diseases and their associated burden on the health care system. Methods: We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis using population-wide hospitalization data for the state of Victoria, Australia. Infection-related hospitalizations for children and adolescents (aged <18 years, total source population ∼1.4 million) were extracted using pre-defined International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) codes. The change in weekly hospitalization rates (incidence rate ratio, IRR) for all infections following the introduction of pandemic-related restrictions from 15 March 2020 was estimated. Results: Over 2015-19, the mean annual incidence of hospitalization with infection among children less than 18 years was 37 per 1000 population. There was an estimated 65% (95% CI 62-67%) reduction in the incidence of overall infection-related hospitalizations associated with the introduction of pandemic restrictions. The reduction was most marked in younger children (at least 66% in those less than 5 years of age) and for lower respiratory tract infections (relative reduction 85%, 95% CI 85-86%). Conclusions: The wider impacts of pandemic mitigation strategies on non-COVID-19 infection-related hospitalizations are poorly understood. We observed marked and rapid decreases in hospitalized childhood infection. In tandem with broader consequences, sustainable measures, such as improved hand hygiene, could reduce the burden of severe childhood infection post-pandemic and the social and economic costs of hospitalization.","['COVID-19', 'Hospitalization', 'Infectious disease', 'Paediatric epidemiology', 'Restrictions']",10.1093/ije/dyab101,1,True

To examine the association between wage-setting policy and food insecurity. Methods. We estimated multilevel regression models, using data from the Gallup World Poll (2014-2017) and UCLA's World Policy Analysis Center, to examine the association between wage setting policy and food insecurity across 139 countries (n = 492 078). Results. Compared with countries with little or no minimum wage, the probability of being food insecure was 0.10 lower (95% confidence interval = 0.02, 0.18) in countries with collective bargaining. However, these associations varied across employment status. More generous wage-setting policies (e.g., collective bargaining or high minimum wages) were associated with lower food insecurity among full-time workers (and, to some extent, part-time workers) but not those who were unemployed. Conclusions. In countries with generous wage-setting policies, employed adults had a lower risk of food insecurity, but the risk of food insecurity for the unemployed was unchanged. Wage-setting policies may be an important intervention for addressing risks of food insecurity among low-income workers.",[],10.2105/AJPH.2020.306096,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2023,The vulnerability to COVID-19 of migrants in large urban areas: Structural exacerbators and community-level mitigators,"Background: Despite research on large urban areas in the context of COVID-19, evidence on how these settings impact migrants is still limited. Objective: To explore exacerbating and mitigating factors of large urban areas on migrants' vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2022, focused on migrants (foreign-born individuals who have not been naturalized in the host country, regardless of legal immigration status) in urban areas with a population >500aŠ000. After screening 880 studies, 29 studies were included and categorized within the following thematic framework: (i) pre-existing inequities, (ii) governance strategies, (iii) urban design and (iv) engagement of civil society organizations (CSOs). Results: Exacerbating factors include pre-existing inequities (e.g. unemployment, financial instability and barriers to healthcare access), exclusionary government responses (e.g. ineligibility for relief funds or unemployment benefits) and residential segregation. Mitigating community-level factors include the engagement of CSOs to fill institutional and governmental gaps through service provision and use of technology. Conclusions: We recommend increased attention to pre-existing structural inequities faced by migrants, more inclusive governance strategies and partnerships between government and CSOs to improve the design and delivery of services to migrants in large urban areas. More research is needed on how urban design can be utilized to mitigate COVID-19 impacts on migrant communities. The factors identified in this systematic review should be considered as part of migrant-inclusive emergency preparedness strategies to address the disproportionate impact of health crises on migrant communities.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckad076,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2021,Marijuana Use Among Women of Reproductive Age With Disabilities,"Introduction: Despite the increasing prevalence and potential adverse health outcomes associated with marijuana use, limited research exists related to its use in women of reproductive age with disabilities. The purpose of this study is to examine the past-month marijuana use in women of reproductive age with disabilities. Methods: Data from the 2015–2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health included 76,765 women of reproductive age (18–44 years). Descriptive statistics and adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the associations between past-month marijuana use and overall disability, including the type of disability. Results: In this sample, 12.6% of women reported past-month marijuana use. Approximately, 21% of women with disabilities reported past-month marijuana use, compared with only 11.1% of women without a disability. Marijuana use was more prevalent in women with disabilities who were younger (aged ≤25 years), who were non-Hispanic White, who were nonmarried, who had at least some college education, and who used alcohol or tobacco. Women with disabilities had 1.68 (95% CI=1.57, 1.80) higher odds of reporting past-month marijuana use than those with no disabilities. The odds of past-month marijuana use were higher among those with cognitive (AOR=1.78, 95% CI=1.64, 1.94), sensory (AOR=1.30, 95% CI=1.12, 1.51), and daily activities–related (AOR=1.64, 95% CI=1.49, 1.80) disabilities than among their counterparts without disabilities. Conclusions: This study found an increased prevalence of past-month marijuana use among women of reproductive age with disabilities. Enhanced screening and counseling using evidence-based practices during routine care for women with disabilities may be necessary to mitigate marijuana use.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2021.04.008,1,True

To estimate the number and prevalence of workers in the United States exposed to chemical hazards available in the Canadian job-exposure matrix (CANJEM) database and examine exposure disparities across sociodemographic groups. Methods. We merged US worker demographic data from the Current Population Survey with CANJEM to characterize the burden and sociodemographic distribution of 244 chemical exposures in the United States in 2021. An interactive version of the full data set is available online (https://deohs.washington.edu/us-exposure-burden). Results. Of the chemical exposures examined, the most prevalent were cleaning and antimicrobial agents (14.7% of workforce estimated exposed), engine emissions (12.8%), organic solvents (12.1%), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (10.1%), and diesel engine emissions (8.3%). Racial and ethnic minoritized groups, persons with lower educational attainment, foreign-born noncitizens, and males were generally overrepresented in exposure to work-related chemical hazards. Conclusions. In the United States, marginalized sociodemographic groups are estimated to experience an inequitable burden to many chemical exposures because of occupational segregation.

We examined the effect of the first three pandemic waves on the number of electronic (e)-referrals to rapid access clinics (RACs) for breast, lung and prostate cancer in Ireland. Methods: This study used a retrospective, repeated cross-sectional design. The predicted weekly number of e-referrals by suspected cancer types from March 2020 to May 2021 was calculated using the Holt-Winters seasonal smoothing method, based on the observed numbers from a representative pre-pandemic period (01 January 2019 to 01 March 2020) and compared this with the observed number across the first three pandemic waves (02 March 2020 to 09 May 2021). Percentage differences were calculated between observed and predicted numbers of e-referrals for the three RACs and patterns were examined in each wave. Results: Observed e-referrals were lower than predicted for all three RACs in the first wave of the pandemic (15.7% lower for breast, 39.5% lower for lung and 28.1% lower for prostate) with varying levels of recovery in the second and third waves for the three e-referral types. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted patterns of e-referrals to RACs in the first three pandemic waves in Ireland. Early identification of changes in engagement with health services, such as a decrease in primary care presentations with a resultant decrease in e-referrals to RACs can allow for a rapid response from cancer control programmes. Continued surveillance of the impact of service disruption on cancer services allows policy makers and strategic leaders in cancer control programmes to respond rapidly to mitigate the impact on cancer outcomes.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckae092,1,True

We aim to explore preference heterogeneity for better-coordinated care delivery models in Swiss older adults, and identify profiles of individuals more open to healthcare reforms. Methods: A DCE (discrete choice experiment) survey was developed online and on paper for the Swiss adults aged 50+, following best practice. To elicit preferences, we estimated a latent class model allowing grouping individuals with similar preferences into distinct classes, and examined what background characteristics contributed to specific class membership. Results: The optimal model identified three classes with different openness to reforms. Class 1 (49%) members were concerned with premium increases and were in favour of integrated care structures with care managed by interprofessional teams. Individuals in class 2 (19%) were younger, open to reforms, and expressed the needs for radical changes within the Swiss healthcare system. Class 3 respondents (32%) were strongly reluctant to changes. Conclusions: Our study goes beyond average preferences and identifies three distinct population profiles, a majority open to reforms on specific aspects of care delivery, a smallest group in favour radical changes, and a third strongly against changes. Therefore, tailored approaches around healthcare reforms are needed, e.g. explaining the role of interprofessional teams in coordinating care, electronic health records and insurance premium variation.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckae004,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2020,Changing levels of local crime and mental health: A natural experiment using self-reported and service use data in Scotland,"Background This study contributes robust evidence on the association between mental health and local crime rates by showing how changing exposure to small area-level crime relates to self-reported and administrative data on mental health. Methods The study sample comprised 112 251 adults aged 16-60 years, drawn from the Scottish Longitudinal Study, a 5.3% representative sample of Scottish population followed across censuses. Outcomes were individual mental health indicators: self-reported mental illness from the 2011 Census and linked administrative data on antidepressants and antipsychotics prescribed through primary care providers in the National Health Service in 2010/2012. Crime rates at data zone level (500-1000 persons) were matched to the participants' main place of residence, as defined by general practitioner patient registration duration during 2004/2006, 2007/2009 and 2010/12. Average neighbourhood crime exposure and change in area crime were computed. Covariate-adjusted logistic regressions were conducted, stratified by moving status. Results In addition to average crime exposure during follow-up, recent increases in crime (2007/2009-2010/2012) were associated with a higher risk of self-reported mental illness, among a € stayers' aged 16-30 years (OR=1.11; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.22), and among a € movers' aged 31-45 years (OR=1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13). Prescribed medications reinforced these findings; worsening crime rates were linked with antidepressant prescriptions among young stayers (OR=1.09; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.14) and with antipsychotic prescriptions among younger middle-aged movers (OR=1.11; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23). Conclusion Changing neighbourhood crime exposure is related to individual mental health, but associations differ by psychiatric conditions, age and moving status.

We examined how age-specific and cause-specific mortality contributions to the socioeconomic gap in life expectancy have changed at the area level in Germany over time. Methods: In this ecological study, official German population and cause-of-death statistics provided by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany for the period Jan 1, 2003, to Dec 31, 2021, were linked to district-level data of the German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation. Life-table and decomposition methods were applied to calculate life expectancy by area-level deprivation quintile and decompose the life-expectancy gap between the most and least deprived quintiles into age-specific and cause-specific mortality contributions. Findings: Over the study period, population numbers varied between 80 million and 83 million people per year, with the number of deaths ranging from 818 000 to 1 024 000, covering the entire German population. Between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2019, the gap in life expectancy between the most and least deprived quintiles of districts increased by 0·7 years among females (from 1·1 to 1·8 years) and by 0·1 years among males (from 3·0 to 3·1 years). Thereafter, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the gap increased more rapidly to 2·2 years in females and 3·5 years in males in 2021. Between 2003 and 2021, the causes of death that contributed the most to the life-expectancy gap were cardiovascular diseases and cancer, with declining contributions of cardiovascular disease deaths among those aged 70 years and older and increasing contributions of cancer deaths among those aged 40–74 years over this period. COVID-19 mortality among individuals aged 45 years and older was the strongest contributor to the increase in life-expectancy gap after 2019. Interpretation: To reduce the socioeconomic gap in life expectancy, effective efforts are needed to prevent early deaths from cardiovascular disease and cancer in socioeconomically deprived populations, with cancer prevention and control becoming an increasingly important field of action in this respect.

Preventive Medicine,2022,The contribution of potentially modifiable risk factors to acute ischemic stroke burden - Comparing young and older adults,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. In order to estimate the contribution of five modifiable risk factors to acute ischemic stroke (AIS) incidence in Israel, we conducted a case-control study based on first AIS cases aged 21–90 reported to the Israeli National Stroke Registry during 2014–2015, and controls from a national health survey conducted between 2013 and 2015. We calculated the population attributable risk (PAR) of each risk factor and the combined PAR for all risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, current smoking, obesity and hyperlipidemia), in all study population and by subgroups of young adults (age < 55) and older adults (age ≥ 55). The final analysis included 571, 577 and 500 matched pairs for all study population, young adults and older adults, respectively. Among young adults, current smoking and hypertension were the two most contributing risk factors for AIS, accounting for 33.6% (95% CI 27.3–39.9) and 28.9% (95% CI 22.1–35.7) of AIS cases, respectively. Among older adults, hypertension was the single most contributing risk factor for AIS and diabetes was the second most contributing risk factor for AIS, accounting for 64.9% (95% CI 57.3–72.5) and 25.7% (95% CI 17.5–33.9) of AIS cases, respectively. The combined PAR was significantly lower among young adults (PAR = 67.9%), compared with older adults (PAR = 80.7%). The combined PAR for all study population was 80.1% (95% CI 74.0–86.2), indicating that five common and modifiable risk factors explain ~80% of AIS incidence in Israel. Primary prevention strategies targeting these risk factors have the potential to drastically reduce stroke related morbidity and mortality.","['Case-control study', 'Ischemic stroke', 'Population attributable risk (PAR)', 'Risk factors', 'Young adults']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106933,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2022,"State Paid Sick Leave and Paid Sick-Leave Preemption Laws Across 50 U.S. States, 2009–2020","Introduction: Paid sick leave is associated with lower mortality risks and increased use of health services. Yet, the U.S. lacks a national law, and not all employers offer paid leave, especially to low-wage workers. States have enacted paid sick-leave laws or preemption laws that prohibit local governments from enacting paid sick-leave requirements. Methods: In 2019 and 2021, state paid sick-leave laws and preemption laws in effect in 2009–2020 were retrieved from Lexis+, coded, and analyzed for coverage and other features. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis were used to estimate the jobs covered by state paid sick-leave laws in 2009–2019. Results: In 2009, no state had a paid sick-leave law, and 1 state had preemption. By 2020, a total of 12 states had paid sick-leave laws, with a form of preemption (n=9) or no preemption (n=3), and 18 additional states solely preempted local laws without requiring coverage, creating a regulatory vacuum in those states. Although all state paid sick-leave laws covered private employers and required care for children and spouses, some laws exempted small or public employers or did not cover additional family members. The percentage of U.S. jobs covered by state-required paid sick leave grew from 0% in 2009 to 27.6% in 2019. Conclusions: Variation in state paid sick-leave laws, preemption, and lack of employer provision of paid sick leave to low-wage workers creates substantial inequities nationally. The federal government should enact a national paid sick-leave law.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2021.11.018,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2023,"Global inequalities in mental health problems: understanding the predictors of lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and perceived helpfulness across 111 countries","Socio-economic inequalities in mental health problems are found in measures covering prevalence, treatment utilisation, and treatment helpfulness. However, whether these inequalities exist globally and what factors explain between-country variation is unclear. We use a nationally representative individual-level survey dataset (Wellcome Global Monitor, 2020) in 111 countries (N = 117,088) to test if socio-economic factors (household income, education), psycho-social factors (stigma perception, trust in health professionals) and country-level factors (GDP, Gini, health expenditure) predict (1) self-reported lifetime prevalence of anxiety and depression symptomology, (2) treatment utilisation and (3) perceived treatment helpfulness talking to a mental health professional and taking prescribed medication. Multi-level logistic regression models were used. Across both HICs and LMICs, being in the richest income quintile within each country is associated with a lower probability of experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to the poorest quintile (OR = 0.67 CI[0.64–0.70]), as well as a higher probability of talking to a mental health professional (OR = 1.25[1.14–1.36]), and of perceiving this treatment as very helpful (OR = 1.23[1.07–1.40]). However, being among the richest income quintile is not associated with taking prescribed medication (OR = 0.97[0.89–1.06]) and its perceived helpfulness (OR = 1.06[0.94–1.21]) across all countries. Trust in health practitioners is associated with higher mental health professional utilisation (OR = 1.10[1.06–1.14]) and helpfulness (OR = 1.32[1.25–1.40]). This analysis reveals a global ‘triple inequality in mental health’, whereby disadvantages of lower SES individuals persist in three outcomes (lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation and helpfulness). Treatment utilisation and helpfulness also vary by trust in healthcare professionals and treatment type. Policymakers must address all three inequalities and their fundamental causes.","['Common mental disorders', 'Depression', 'Global mental health', 'Health inequalities', 'Help-seeking mental healthcare', 'Mental health stigma', 'Social determinants of health']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2023.107769,1,True
The Lancet Public Health,2020,"The effect of frailty on survival in patients with COVID-19 (COPE): a multicentre, European, observational cohort study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on health-care systems. Frailty is being used in clinical decision making for patients with COVID-19, yet the prevalence and effect of frailty in people with COVID-19 is not known. In the COVID-19 in Older PEople (COPE) study we aimed to establish the prevalence of frailty in patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and investigate its association with mortality and duration of hospital stay. Methods: This was an observational cohort study conducted at ten hospitals in the UK and one in Italy. All adults (≥18 years) admitted to participating hospitals with COVID-19 were included. Patients with incomplete hospital records were excluded. The study analysed routinely generated hospital data for patients with COVID-19. Frailty was assessed by specialist COVID-19 teams using the clinical frailty scale (CFS) and patients were grouped according to their score (1–2=fit; 3–4=vulnerable, but not frail; 5–6=initial signs of frailty but with some degree of independence; and 7–9=severe or very severe frailty). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality (time from hospital admission to mortality and day-7 mortality). Findings: Between Feb 27, and April 28, 2020, we enrolled 1564 patients with COVID-19. The median age was 74 years (IQR 61–83); 903 (57·7%) were men and 661 (42·3%) were women; 425 (27·2%) had died at data cutoff (April 28, 2020). 772 (49·4%) were classed as frail (CFS 5–8) and 27 (1·7%) were classed as terminally ill (CFS 9). Compared with CFS 1–2, the adjusted hazard ratios for time from hospital admission to death were 1·55 (95% CI 1·00–2·41) for CFS 3–4, 1·83 (1·15–2·91) for CFS 5–6, and 2·39 (1·50–3·81) for CFS 7–9, and adjusted odds ratios for day-7 mortality were 1·22 (95% CI 0·63–2·38) for CFS 3–4, 1·62 (0·81–3·26) for CFS 5–6, and 3·12 (1·56–6·24) for CFS 7–9. Interpretation: In a large population of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, disease outcomes were better predicted by frailty than either age or comorbidity. Our results support the use of CFS to inform decision making about medical care in adult patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Funding: None.",[],10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30146-8,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2023,Association between language barrier and inadequate prenatal care utilization among migrant women in the PreCARE prospective cohort study,"Background: Inadequate prenatal care utilization (PCU) is involved in the higher risk of adverse maternal outcomes among migrant vs. native women. Language barrier may be a risk factor for inadequate PCU. We aimed to assess the association between this barrier and inadequate PCU among migrant women. Methods: This analysis took place in the French multicentre prospective PreCARE cohort study, conducted in four university hospital maternity units in the northern Paris area. It included 10 419 women giving birth between 2010 and 2012. Migrants' language barrier to communication in French were categorized into three groups: migrants with no, partial or total language barrier. Inadequate PCU was assessed by the date prenatal care began, the proportion of recommended prenatal visits completed and ultrasound scans performed. The associations between these language barrier categories and inadequate PCU were tested with multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Among the 4803 migrant women included, the language barrier was partial for 785 (16.3%) and total for 181 (3.8%). Compared to migrants with no language barrier, those with partial [risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.33] and total (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10-1.50) language barrier were at higher risk of inadequate PCU. Adjustment for maternal age, parity and region of birth did not modify these associations, which were noted particularly among socially deprived women. Conclusion: Migrant women with language barrier have a higher risk of inadequate PCU than those without. These findings underscore the importance of targeted efforts to bring women with language barrier to prenatal care.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckad078,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2022,Implementation research to accelerate scale-up of national screen and treat strategies towards the elimination of cervical cancer,"Background: Cervical cancer is a significant public health problem, with 570,000 new cases and 300,000 deaths of women per year globally, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. In 2018 the WHO Director General made a call to action for the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. Main body: New thinking on programmatic approaches to introduce emerging technologies and screening and treatment interventions of cervical precancer at scale is needed to achieve elimination goals. Implementation research (IR) is an important yet underused tool for facilitating scale-up of evidence-based screening and treatment interventions, as most research has focused on developing and evaluating new interventions. It is time for countries to define their specific IR needs to understand acceptability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of interventions as to design and ensure effective implementation, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based screening and treatment interventions. WHO convened an expert advisory group to identify priority IR questions for HPV-based screening and treatment interventions in population-based programmes. Several international organizations are supporting large scale introduction of screen-and-treat approaches in many countries, providing ideal platforms to evaluate different approaches and strategies in diverse national contexts. Conclusion: For reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality, the readiness of health systems, the reach and effectiveness of new technologies and algorithms for increasing screening and treatment coverage, and the factors that support sustainability of these programmes need to be better understood. Answering these key IR questions could provide actionable guidance for countries seeking to implement the WHO Global Strategy towards cervical cancer elimination.",[],10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106906,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2022,"Childhood Neighborhood Disadvantage, Parenting, and Adult Health","Introduction: Growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods is associated with poor adult health indicators. Consistent and supportive parenting plays a key role in life-long health, but it is not known whether positive parenting can mitigate the relationship between neighborhood adversity and poor health. This study examines parenting as a moderator of the links between childhood neighborhood characteristics and adult health indicators. Methods: A sample of 305 individuals (61% female; 82% African American, 18% Caucasian) were assessed in childhood (T1; age 11 years; 2003‒2004) and adulthood (T2; age 27 years; 2018‒2021). At T1, neighborhood poverty was derived from census data; neighborhood disorder was reported by parents. Children reported on parental harsh discipline, inconsistent discipline, and parental nurturance. At T2, health outcomes included BMI, serum cortisol and C-reactive protein (CRP), and salivary DNA methylation index related to CRP. Regression models predicted T2 health outcomes from T1 neighborhood and parenting variables and their interactions, adjusting for clustering and confounders. Data were analyzed in 2021. Results: Neighborhood poverty was associated with lower cortisol, whereas neighborhood disorder was linked with CRP‒related DNA methylation. Multiple interactions between neighborhood and parenting variables emerged, indicating that adverse neighborhood conditions were only related to poor adult health when combined with inconsistent discipline and low parental nurturance. By contrast, warm and supportive parenting, consistent discipline, and to a lesser extent harsh discipline buffered children from poor health outcomes associated with neighborhood disadvantage. Conclusions: Interventions enhancing consistent and nurturing parenting may help to reduce the long-term associations of neighborhood disadvantage with poor health.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2022.01.028,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2020,The geriatric workforce in Romania: The need to improve data and management,"Facing severe under-funding and significant workforce maldistribution, the health system in Romania is challenged to provide adequate care for the ageing population. The aim of this article is to connect health labour market data of the geriatrics workforce in Romania with individual perceptions of front-line workers in geriatrics in order to better understand the ‘human’ factors of effective health workforce development. Comprehensive health workforce data are not available; we therefore used a rapid scoping review and interviews to combine quantitative and qualitative data sources, such as the ‘Healthcare Facility Activity Report’, policy documents and available reports. They show that despite a consistent increase in the overall number of geriatricians, their majority is based in Bucharest, the capital city. The initial review points to possible geriatrician burnout, caused in part by high workload. The geriatrics workforce in Romania is poorly developed. Significant efforts are still needed to create policies addressing inflows and outflows, training, maldistribution and inefficiencies related to their practice. Addressing burnout by improving teamwork and collaboration is vital for maintaining and improving the workforce morale and motivation. Two major policy recommendations emerged: an urgent need for better health workforce data in Romania and development of more effective workforce management.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckaa127,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2020,Patterns of long-term conditions in older age and subsequent mortality: A national study of inequalities in health,"Background: Multiple long-term health conditions in older people are associated with increased mortality. The study aims to identify patterns of long-term health in a national ageing population using a census-based self-reported indicator of long-term health conditions. We assessed associations with subsequent mortality and socio-economic and demographic risk factors. Methods: Using linked administrative data from the Northern Ireland Mortality Study, we assessed the presence of latent classes of morbidity in self-reported data on 11 long-term health conditions in a population aged 65 or more (N = 244 349). These classes were associated with demographic and socio-economic predictors using multi-nomial logistic regression. In a 3.75-year follow-up, all-cause and cause-specific mortality were regressed on morbidity patterns. Results: Four latent classes of long-term ill-health conditions were derived, and labelled: 'low impairment'; 'pain/mobility'; 'cognitive/mental'; 'sensory impairment'. Groupings reflecting higher levels of long-term ill-health were associated with class-specific increases in all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Strongest effects were found for the 'cognitive/mental' group, which predicted all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.96: 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.83, 3.10) as well as some cause-specific mortality (i.e. dementia-related death: HR = 10.78: 95% CI = 9.39, 12.15). Class membership was predicted by a range of socio-demographic factors. Lower socio-economic status was associated with poorer health. Conclusion: Results indicate that long-term ill-health clusters in specific patterns, which are both predicted by socio-demographic factors and are themselves predictive of mortality in the elderly. The syndromic nature of long-term ill-health and functioning in ageing populations has implications for healthcare planning and public health policy in older populations.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckz194,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2020,"Impact of a vaccine intervention on county-level rates of acute hepatitis B in West Virginia, 2011–2018","The rate of acute hepatitis B in West Virginia (WV) has been increasing since 2006. To reduce new infections, WV implemented a vaccine intervention (WV Pilot Project), which provided over 10,000 doses of hepatitis B vaccine to at-risk adults in 18 counties. The objectives of this study were to describe yearly changes in acute hepatitis B incidence and assess county-level impact of the WV Pilot Project using geospatial methods. County rates of acute hepatitis B and vaccine doses per 100,000 population were visualized biannually from 2011 to 2018. Local indicators of spatial autocorrelation were used to detect county-level clustering. Significant differences in the median rate of acute hepatitis B pre and post intervention in counties receiving vaccine were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and bootstrapping. A Bland-Altman graph visualized significant differences in county-level rates of acute hepatitis B before and after the WV Pilot Project compared to the statewide estimate. Analyses identified significant geographic clustering of acute hepatitis B in southern WV across all four time-periods. Nine of the 18 (50%) counties receiving vaccine had significant declines in acute hepatitis B incidence compared to the statewide mean difference estimate. Findings suggest that increased dissemination of hepatitis B vaccine through local health departments and existing harm reduction services can reduce the incidence of acute hepatitis B in states such as WV, which have been disproportionately affected by substance misuse.","['Cluster analysis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B vaccine', 'Vaccine intervention']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106121,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2021,Academic Detailing to Increase Prescribing of HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis,"Although HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis can decrease new cases of HIV by up to 99%, many patients who could benefit from pre-exposure prophylaxis never receive prescriptions for it. Because pre-exposure prophylaxis is indicated for patients who do not have an infectious disease, increasing pre-exposure prophylaxis prescribing by primary care and generalist clinicians represents a key element of the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative. This review provides an overview of academic detailing and how it is currently being used to increase pre-exposure prophylaxis prescribing. Academic detailing is outreach education that engages with clinicians in 1-to-1 or small group interactions focused on identifying and addressing an individual clinician's needs to increase their use of evidence-based practices. Academic detailing has been proven in multiple previous research studies, and the principles required for successful implementation include interactivity, clinical relevance of content, and focus on defined behavior change objectives. Clinician barriers to pre-exposure prophylaxis prescribing may occur in the domains of knowledge, attitudes, or behavior, and academic detailing has the potential to address all of these areas. State and local health departments have developed academic detailing programs focused on pre-exposure prophylaxis prescribing and other elements of HIV prevention—sometimes describing the approach as public health detailing. Few studies of academic detailing for pre-exposure prophylaxis have been published to date; rigorous evaluation of HIV-specific adaptations and innovations of the approach would represent an important contribution. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in virtual delivery of academic detailing has grown, which could inform efforts to implement academic detailing in rural communities and other underserved areas. Increasing this capacity could make an important contribution to Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. and other HIV prevention efforts.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2021.05.030,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2022,Variability in perceived burden and health trajectories among older caregivers: A population-based study in Sweden,"Background The negative effects of informal caregiving are determined by the characteristics of the caregiver-care receiver dyad and the context of care. In this study, we aimed to identify which subgroups of older informal caregivers (1) experience the greatest subjective burden and (2) incur a faster decline in objective health status. Methods From a total of 3363 older participants in the Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K), we identified 629 informal caregivers (19.2%, mean age 69.9 years). Limitations to life and perceived burden were self-reported, and objective health status was quantified using the comprehensive clinical and functional Health Assessment Tool (HAT) score (range: 0-10). Ordered logistic regressions and linear mixed models were used to estimate the associations between caregiving-related exposures and subjective outcomes (cross-sectionally) and objective health trajectories (over 12 years), respectively. Results Having a dual role (providing and receiving care simultaneously), caring for a spouse, living in the same household as the care receiver and spending more hours on caregiving were associated with more limitations and burden. In addition, having a dual role (β=-0.12, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.02) and caring for a spouse (β=-0.08, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.02) were associated with a faster HAT score decline. Being female and having a poor social network were associated with an exacerbation of the health decline. Conclusions Both the heterogeneity among caregivers and the related contextual factors should be accounted for by policymakers as well as in future research investigating the health impact of informal caregiving.","['Aging', 'Gerontology', 'Health']",10.1136/jech-2022-219095,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2024,"Effect of retirement on loneliness: a longitudinal comparative analysis across Australia, China and the USA","Background There is evidence that the transition to retirement can bring social challenges and may increase loneliness. Few studies have examined the impact of retirement on loneliness; most have been conducted in Western countries. It is important to examine the differences in loneliness postretirement across countries to identify patterns and risk factors that might influence the health and well-being of older adults. We aimed to examine the effect of retirement on loneliness among older adults in Australia, China and the USA. Methods Longitudinal analysis of data from population-based samples of Australian, Chinese and American adults over 50. Lagged and fully lagged adjusted models were applied. Social engagement was examined as an effect modifier and a sensitivity analysis was conducted among urban participants. Results Retirees had a higher predicted prevalence of loneliness than non-retirees in Australia (19.4% (95% CI 18.0% to 20.9%) vs 17.0% (95% CI 15.7% to 18.4%)) and in the USA (19.3% (95% CI 17.5% to 21.1%) vs 15.7% (95% CI 14.3% to 17.3%)). These differences were significant only in the USA. In China, loneliness was significantly lower in those who had retired (10.0% (95% CI 7.9% to 12.5%) vs 17.1% (95% CI 15.7% to 18.5%)). In Australia and the USA, voluntary retirees had the lowest loneliness and involuntary retirees had the highest. Social engagement did not modify the association between retirement and loneliness. Conclusions Our findings imply that the effect of retirement should be considered within a cultural context to inform suitable and effective strategies to alleviate loneliness.","['AGING', 'MENTAL HEALTH', 'PUBLIC HEALTH', 'SOCIAL SCIENCES']",10.1136/jech-2023-221606,1,True
