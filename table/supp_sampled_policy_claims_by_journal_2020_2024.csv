American Journal Of Public Health,2024,Ventilation and Public Health: A Fraught History,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a vigorous public health discussion has arisen over indoor air quality and ventilation. In popular press articles, bestselling books, and the US Environmental Protection Agency’s recently announced Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, scholars and policy experts have claimed that improved ventilation systems can lead to better productivity and performance. By reevaluating those claims in light of the history of public health in Great Britain and the United States, we found that better ventilation has frequently been proposed as a cost-effective and nonintrusive means of improving health in institutions experiencing structural and environmental public health problems. Furthermore, our examination of efforts to provide ventilation for enslaved people, incarcerated people, and the urban poor revealed a consistent lack of government regulation and a disassociation of air quality concerns from broader environmental, social, and economic realities. By continuing to ignore these broader contexts, current ventilation efforts risk repeating this pattern.

American Journal Of Public Health,2024,Pragmatic Approach to the Assessment and Use of Digital Mental Health Interventions for Health Workers,"Symptoms of poor mental health among working people, especially health workers, are on the rise in the United States, contributing to a burgeoning market of thousands of mental health technology products, few of which have undergone rigorous evaluation. Most research on these products focuses on deploying digital mental health interventions as ancillary support in clinical practice and community settings. Little is known of the effectiveness of these tools when employers offer them. We describe the landscape of digital mental health interventions, providing an overview of mental health conditions that are addressed with technology-based solutions in the workplace and the products and services available. We argue for employers to apply a methodical approach to evaluating and selecting technologies for their organizations, and we review relevant frameworks for evaluation. Considering the rapidly evolving landscape of digital mental health interventions, we offer evidence-informed recommendations to organizations and decision-makers seeking to support workplace mental health and well-being, and we advocate the development of products that help organizations assess how they can mitigate workplace conditions that may contribute to poorer mental health.",[],10.2105/AJPH.2023.307505,1,True
International Journal Of Epidemiology,2021,Predicting and forecasting the impact of local outbreaks of COVID-19: Use of SEIR-D quantitative epidemiological modelling for healthcare demand and capacity,"Background: The world is experiencing local/regional hotspots and spikes in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19 disease. We aimed to formulate an applicable epidemiological model to accurately predict and forecast the impact of local outbreaks of COVID-19 to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity, policy-making and public health decisions. Methods: The model utilized the aggregated daily COVID-19 situation reports (including counts of daily admissions, discharges and bed occupancy) from the local National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and COVID-19-related weekly deaths in hospitals and other settings in Sussex (population 1.7 million), Southeast England. These data sets corresponded to the first wave of COVID-19 infections from 24 March to 15 June 2020. A novel epidemiological predictive and forecasting model was then derived based on the local/regional surveillance data. Through a rigorous inverse parameter inference approach, the model parameters were estimated by fitting the model to the data in an optimal sense and then subsequent validation. Results: The inferred parameters were physically reasonable and matched up to the widely used parameter values derived from the national data sets by Biggerstaff M, Cowling BJ, Cucunubá ZM et al. (Early insights from statistical and mathematical modeling of key epidemiologic parameters of COVID-19, Emerging infectious diseases. 2020;26(11)). We validate the predictive power of our model by using a subset of the available data and comparing the model predictions for the next 10, 20 and 30 days. The model exhibits a high accuracy in the prediction, even when using only as few as 20 data points for the fitting. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that by using local/regional data, our predictive and forecasting model can be utilized to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity, policy-making and public health decisions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the local population. Understanding how future COVID-19 spikes/waves could possibly affect the regional populations empowers us to ensure the timely commissioning and organization of services. The flexibility of timings in the model, in combination with other early-warning systems, produces a time frame for these services to prepare and isolate capacity for likely and potential demand within regional hospitals. The model also allows local authorities to plan potential mortuary capacity and understand the burden on crematoria and burial services. The model algorithms have been integrated into a web-based multi-institutional toolkit, which can be used by NHS hospitals, local authorities and public health departments in other regions of the UK and elsewhere. The parameters, which are locally informed, form the basis of predicting and forecasting exercises accounting for different scenarios and impacts of COVID-19 transmission.","['COVID-19', 'forecasting', 'healthcare demand', 'parameter inference', 'SEIR-D epidemiological model']",10.1093/ije/dyab106,1,True
The Lancet Public Health,2023,Clustering of adverse health and educational outcomes in adolescence following early childhood disadvantage: population-based retrospective UK cohort study,"Background: Disadvantage in early childhood (ages 0–5 years) is associated with worse health and educational outcomes in adolescence. Evidence on the clustering of these adverse outcomes by household income is scarce in the generation of adolescents born since the turn of the millennium. We aimed to describe the association between household income in early childhood and physical health, psychological distress, smoking behaviour, obesity, and educational outcomes at age 17 years, including the patterning and clustering of these five outcomes by income quintiles. Methods: In this population-based, retrospective cohort study, we used data from the Millennium Cohort Study in which individuals born in the UK between Sept 1, 2000, and Jan 1, 2002, were followed up. We collected data on five adverse health and social outcomes in adolescents aged 17 years known to limit life chances: psychological distress, self-assessed ill health, smoking, obesity, and poor educational achievement. We compared how single and multiple outcomes were distributed across early childhood quintile groups of income, as an indicator of disadvantage, and modelled the potential effect of three income-shifting scenarios in early childhood for reducing adverse outcomes in adolescence. Findings: We included 15 245 adolescents aged 17 years, 7788 (51·1%) of whom were male and 7457 (48·9%) of whom were female. Adolescents in the lowest income quintile group in childhood were 12·7 (95% CI 6·4–25·1) times more likely than those in the highest quintile group to have four or five adverse adolescent outcomes, with poor educational achievement (risk ratio [RR] 4·6, 95% CI 4·2–5·0) and smoking (3·6, 3·0–4·2), showing the largest single risk ratios. Shifting up to the second lowest, middle, and highest income groups would reduce multiple adolescent adversities by 4·9% (95% CI –23·8 to 33·6), 32·3% (–2·7 to 67·3), and 83·9% (47·2 to 120·7), respectively. Adjusting for parental education and single parent status moderately attenuated these estimates. Interpretation: Early childhood disadvantage is more strongly correlated with multiple adolescent adversities than any of the five single adverse outcomes. However, shifting children from the lowest income quintile group to the next lowest group is ineffective. Tackling multiple adolescent adversities requires managing early childhood disadvantage across the social gradient, with income redistribution as a central element of coordinated cross-sectoral action.

Epidemiology,2023,US Racial-Ethnic Mortality Gap Adjusted for Population Structure,"Background: US racial-ethnic mortality disparities are well documented and central to debates on social inequalities in health. Standard measures, such as life expectancy or years of life lost, are based on synthetic populations and do not account for the real underlying populations experiencing the inequalities. Methods: We analyze US mortality disparities comparing Asian Americans, Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans/Alaska Natives to Whites using 2019 CDC and NCHS data, using a novel approach that estimates the mortality gap, adjusted for population structure by accounting for real-population exposures. This measure is tailored for analyses where age structures are fundamental, not merely a confounder. We highlight the magnitude of inequalities by comparing the population structure-adjusted mortality gap against standard metrics' estimates of loss of life due to leading causes. Results: Based on the population structure-adjusted mortality gap, Black and Native American mortality disadvantage exceedsmortality from circulatory diseases. The disadvantage is 72% among Blacks (men: 47%, women: 98%) and 65% among Native Americans (men: 45%, women: 92%), larger than life expectancy measured disadvantage. In contrast, estimated advantages for Asian Americans are over three times (men: 176%, women: 283%) and, for Hispanics, two times (men: 123%; women: 190%) larger than those based on life expectancy. Conclusions: Mortality inequalities based on standard metrics' synthetic populations can differ markedly from estimates of the population structure-adjusted mortality gap. We demonstrate that standard metrics underestimate racial-ethnic disparities through disregarding actual population age structures. Exposure-corrected measures of inequality may better inform health policies around allocation of scarce resources.","['Age structure', 'Exposure', 'Mortality', 'Racial disparities']",10.1097/EDE.0000000000001595,1,True
American Journal Of Epidemiology,2020,"Early outpatient treatment of symptomatic, high-risk covid-19 patients that should be ramped up immediately as key to the pandemic crisis","More than 1.6 million Americans have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and more than 10 times that number carry antibodies to it. High-risk patients with progressing symptomatic disease currently have only hospitalization treatment, with its high mortality, available to them. An outpatient treatment that prevents hospitalization is desperately needed. Two candidate medications have been widely discussed: remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) + azithromycin (AZ). Remdesivir has shown mild effectiveness in hospitalized inpatients, but no trials in outpatients have been registered. HCQ + AZ has been widely misrepresented in both clinical reports and public media, and results of outpatient trials are not expected until September. Early outpatient illness is very different from later f lorid disease requiring hospitalization, and the treatments differ. Evidence about use of HCQ alone, or of HCQ + AZ in inpatients, is irrelevant with regard to the efficacy of HCQ + AZ in early high-risk outpatient disease. Five studies, including 2 controlled clinical trials, have demonstrated significant major outpatient treatment efficacy. HCQ + AZ has been used as the standard of care in more than 300,000 older adults with multiple comorbid conditions; the estimated proportion of such patients diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia attributable to the medications is 47 per 100,000 users, among whom estimated mortality is less than 20% (9/100,000 users), as compared with the 10,000 Americans now dying each week. These medications need to be made widely available and promoted immediately for physicians to prescribe.","['Azithromycin', 'Coronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Doxycycline', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Remdesivir', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Zinc']",10.1093/aje/kwaa093,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2021,"Identifying nonfatal firearm assault incidents through linking police data and clinical records: Cohort study in Indianapolis, Indiana, 2007–2016","Nonfatal firearm assault incidents are more prevalent than gun homicides, however, little is understood about nonfatal firearm assault incidents due to a lack of accurate data in the United States. This is a descriptive study of all nonfatal firearm assault incidents identified through police and clinical records from 2007 to 2016 in Indianapolis, Indiana. Records were linked at the incident level to demonstrate the overlap and non-overlap of nonfatal firearm assault incidents in police and clinical records and describe differences in demographic characteristics of the victims. Incidents were matched within a 24-h time window of the recorded date of the police incident. Data were analyzed in fall 2020. There were 3797 nonfatal firearm assault incidents identified in police reports and 3131 clinical encounters with an ICD 9/10 diagnosis-based nonfatal firearm-related injury. 62% (n = 2366) of nonfatal firearm assault incidents matched within 24 h to a clinical encounter, 81% (n = 1905) had a firearm related ICD code: 40% (n = 947) were coded as a firearm-related assault, 32% (n = 754) were coded as a firearm-related accident; and 8.6% (n = 198) were coded as undetermined, self-inflicted or law enforcement firearm-related. The other 20% (n = 461) did not have an ICD firearm related diagnosis code. Results indicate most nonfatal firearm assault incidents overlap between police and clinical records systems, however, discrepancies between the systems exist. These findings also demonstrate an undercounting of nonfatal firearm assault incidents when relying on clinical data systems alone and more efforts are needed to link administrative police and clinical data in the study of nonfatal firearm assaults.",[],10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106605,1,True
American Journal Of Public Health,2024,"Talents, Tears, Stories of Our Identities, and Community Building: Toward Community-Based Ecosystems of Latiné Health Driven by Promotores","This essay describes a process for integrating US Latiné communities as drivers of a grassroots vision for healthy Latiné communities and health equity planning that addresses racial injustices. Transforming structural conditions to promote Latiné community health happens alongside creating conditions for community-level self-determination to foster community-based ecosystems of health. Integrating a life course perspective, we describe a vision for community-based ecosystems of Latiné health that is rooted in forging connections and cultivating community; building community power to address structural drivers of health; leveraging the expertise and assets of promotores to reach, engage, and mobilize communities; scaling solutions through policy, system, and environment changes; and grounding research processes in community-driven priorities. Such processes must affirm the expertise of promotores and Latiné communities and recognize the interconnectedness of communities and systems (e.g., food, housing, living wages) to nurture health at local levels. Research can advance the science and evidence-based models that support community-based ecosystems of Latiné health.",[],10.2105/AJPH.2024.307763,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2020,"European Union initiatives in child immunization - The need for child centricity, e-health and holistic delivery","Background: Low childhood immunization rates in Europe are causing concern and have triggered several EU initiatives. However, these are counter-factual as they make immunization a stand-alone issue and cut across best practice in integrated child health services. They also focus unduly on 'anti-vax' pressures, generalize 'vaccine hesitancy' and overlook practical difficulties and uncertainties encountered by parents in real world situations about presenting children for immunization. Meanwhile European expertize in child health electronic record systems and relevant standards are ignored despite their being a potentially sound foundation ripe for enhancement. Methods: Situation and literature reviews, and cohesion of two European research projects, led to shared investigation. As a result, two cross-sectoral expert workshops were held to consider digital health standards for harmonizing integrated preventive child health including immunization, and the work of other stakeholders such as the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Control. Results: Progress in child health information models and digital health standards was assessed, areas needing further standards development identified and desirable steps towards innovation in service delivery and record keeping agreed. Conclusion: The European Commission, member states and child health stakeholders should take an integrated approach to child health with immunization as a component. Service delivery should be sensitive to parental concerns and challenges, and the way child- and family-centric data are recorded and used should be enhanced. Services should be enabled by the International Patient Summary and related electronic health record standards and linkages, and evaluated to assess most effective systems and practice.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckz199,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2022,"Workplace Violence, Workforce Stability, and Well-being in China's Psychiatric Hospitals","Introduction: Workplace violence against psychiatric professionals is a growing problem, yet nationally representative data in China are lacking. This study examines workplace violence against psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses in China as well as its association with workforce stability and well-being. Methods: Data came from a 2019 national survey of 14,264 participants (including 4,520 psychiatrists and 9,744 nurses) from 41 psychiatric hospitals across China. The occurrence of physical and verbal assaults among psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses was reported. Logistic regression models were constructed to examine the participants’ characteristics associated with encountering workplace violence and the association of encountering violence with self-reported quality of life, health status, turnover intention, and career satisfaction. Analyses were performed during 2020. Results: In 2019, among 14,264 psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses in China, 81% reported encountering workplace violence during the past year. Psychiatrists were 0.68 (95% CI=0.55, 0.83) times less likely to report an encounter of violence than nurses. Male and younger nurses were 2.20 (95% CI=1.72, 2.81) and 1.21 (95% CI=1.01, 1.45) times more likely to report violence. Psychiatrists who had a higher educational degree or a higher professional rank were more vulnerable to violence. Encountering violence was significantly associated with poor quality of life, less satisfaction with health status, greater intention to leave the current job, and career dissatisfaction. Conclusions: Workplace violence against psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses are common in China, indicating that China's psychiatric professionals are facing a significant threat to occupational safety. To maintain psychiatric workforce stability, actions are needed to reduce the prevalence of workplace violence at the system, institutional, and individual levels.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2021.09.013,1,True

The Lancet Public Health,2024,"Homelessness, psychiatric disorders, and violence in Denmark: a population-based cohort study","Background: Homelessness is associated with adverse health and social outcomes. People experiencing homelessness have been found to have a high risk of violent crime victimisation as well as high prevalence of psychiatric disorders. It is poorly understood whether experiencing homelessness is associated with additional risks of violent offending and whether psychiatric disorders contribute to these risks. We examined the association between homelessness, psychiatric disorders, and first violence offence leading to conviction. Methods: We did a nationwide, register-based cohort study of all Danish residents who were alive at least 1 day during the study period, born between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2006, and aged 15 years or older retrieved from the Danish Civil Registration System, which was linked to registers with information on homelessness, health care, and criminality. The exposure was any experience of homelessness, which was defined as having at least one contact with a homeless shelter during the study period. The outcome was first violent offence leading to a conviction. We calculated incidence rates per 10 000 person-years, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using Poisson regression analysis, and probability of conviction of a violent offence using an Aalen–Johansen estimator. Analyses were stratified by sex and adjusted for calendar year of the study period, age, other sociodemographic factors, and psychiatric disorders. Findings: The study cohort included 1 786 433 Danish residents aged 15–42 years living in Denmark at some point from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2021, contributing to 21 336 322 person-years at risk, of whom 57 084 (3·2%) individuals had their first violent offence leading to conviction during follow-up. 10 years after their first contact with a homeless shelter, 22·9% (95% CI 21·6–24·2) of men and 7·7% (6·8–8·7) of women had committed at least one violent crime leading to conviction. The fully adjusted IRRs of a violent offence leading to conviction were 4·8 (4·5–5·1) in men and 6·3 (5·6–7·2) in women experiencing homelessness compared with individuals who had not experienced homelessness. The IRR for a violent offence leading to conviction was highest in individuals experiencing homelessness and having co-occurring psychiatric disorders compared with those not experiencing homelessness and without co-occurring psychiatric disorders, especially drug use disorders (IRR in those experiencing homelessness and having a drug use disorder: 15·3 [14·1–16·7] in men and 40·1 [33·9–47·5] in women compared with individuals not experiencing homelessness and having no drug use disorder). Interpretation: Individuals experiencing homelessness had higher risks of a violent offence leading to conviction than those who had not experienced homelessness. In addition to preventing homelessness, public health and policy should consider how to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in people experiencing homelessness.

Preventive Medicine,2024,Age-varying associations between attempts to change weight and suicidal ideation among adolescents in the United States,"Purpose: The goal of this study was to inform theory and suicide prevention efforts by examining how the link between attempts to change weight and suicidal ideation varies across adolescence, when it is strongest, and whether there are sex differences. Methods: Data were from 13,518 youth ages 14–18 years who participated in the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative study of U.S. high school students. Time-varying effect modeling was used to estimate associations between attempts to change weight and suicidal ideation as continuous functions of age and to test sex differences in these links. Results: The link between attempts to lose weight and suicidal ideation was positive and significant between ages 14.0–17.3 years, with the strongest association at age 15.0 (OR = 2.07). There were no sex differences in this age-varying association. The association between attempts to gain weight and suicidal ideation was positive and age-varying for girls, with the strongest association at age 17.2 years (OR = 2.79). This association was not significant for boys at any age. Conclusions: Girls and boys who are trying to lose weight and girls who are trying to gain weight may be at elevated risk for suicidal ideation between ages 14 and 18 years.

American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2024,"Time Series Analysis: Associations Between Temperature and Primary Care Utilization in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Introduction: Earth's temperature has risen by an average of 0.11°F per decade since 1850 and experts predict continued global warming. Studies have shown that exposure to extreme temperatures is associated with adverse health outcomes. Missed primary care visits can lead to incomplete preventive health screenings and unmanaged chronic diseases. This study examines the associations between extreme temperature conditions and primary care utilization among adult Philadelphians. Methods: A total of 1,048,575 appointments from 91,580 patients age ≥ 18 years enrolled in the study at thirteen university-based outpatient clinics in Philadelphia from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2019. Statistical analysis was performed from June to December 2023. Data on attended and missed appointments was linked with measures of daily maximum temperature and precipitation, stratified by warm and cold seasons. Sociodemographic variables and associations with chronic disease status were explored. Results: Rates of missed appointments increased by 0.72% for every 1°F decrease in daily maximum temperatures below 39°F and increased by 0.64% for every 1°F increase above 89°F. Individuals ≥ 65 years and those with chronic conditions had stronger associations with an increased rate of missed appointments. Conclusions: Temperature extremes were associated with higher rates of missed primary care appointments. Individuals with chronic diseases were more likely to have missed appointments associated with extreme temperatures. The findings suggest the need for primary care physicians to explore different modes of care delivery to support vulnerable populations, such as making telemedicine during extreme weather events a viable and affordable option.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2024.06.014,1,True

Observed mortality was 23%–32% higher than expected among individuals aged 50 years and older. Non-White residents of Baltimore City also experienced 2 to 3 times higher rates of excess mortality than White residents (e.g., 37.4 vs. 10.7 excess deaths per 10,000 population among Black residents vs. White residents). There was little to no observed excess mortality among residents of hospice, long-term care, and nursing home facilities, despite accounting for nearly 30% (312/1,050) of recorded COVID-19 deaths. There was significant geographic variation in excess mortality within the city, largely following racial population distributions.

American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2024,"Federal Firearm Licensee Rates and Suicide in Maryland, 2014 to 2019","Introduction: Federal firearm licensee density is associated with interpersonal firearm violence. Yet the role of Federal firearm licensees in firearm suicide remains understudied, even though firearms are the method used in more than half of suicides. This study tested associations between the spatial distribution of federal firearm licensees and firearm suicides in Maryland. Methods: Kernel density estimation measured federal firearm licensee and suicide rates at the census tract level (n=1,397), and SaTScan detected clusters of licensees and suicides. Choropleth maps compared visual associations between federal firearm licensee, firearm, and non-firearm suicide rates and clusters. Generalized estimating equations tested associations between Federal firearm licensee rates and clusters and the odds of using a firearm as the lethal means overall and after stratifying by biological sex. Data were obtained in 2020 and analyzed in 2020–2024. Results: The federal firearm licensee rate was associated with greater odds of firearm suicide overall (aOR=1.29, 95% CI=1.21, 1.38, p<0.001), for men (aOR=1.29, 95% CI=1.20, 1.39, p<0.001), and for women (aOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.07, 1.49, p=0.007). Suicide decedents in a census tract located in a federal firearm licensee cluster (vs not) had higher odds of firearm use overall (aOR=1.70, 95% CI=1.28, 2.27, p<0.001) and for men (aOR=1.67, 95% CI=1.22, 2.27, p=0.001), but not for women (aOR=1.65, 95% CI=0.81, 3.34, p=0.168). Conclusions: The federal firearm licensee rate and clusters were associated with firearm suicides and unrelated to the spatial distribution of non-firearm suicides.

In 2012 Spain approved its Strategy 2012-20, one of the central aims of which is to reduce social inequalities in health that affect the Roma population. Our objective was to analyze changes in health inequalities between the Roma population and the general population in Spain in the years 2006 and 2014. Methods: The Spanish National Health Surveys (NHSs) 2006 (n 29 478) and 2012 (n 20 884) and the NHS of the Spanish Roma Population 2006 (n 933) and 2014 (n 1155) were compared. This study considered the variables included in NRIS 2012-20: Selfperceived health, tobacco use in men, traffic accidents in men and women, obesity in women and gynaecological visits. Results: Despite the adoption of the NRIS 2012-20, there were no observed improvements in health between 2006 and 2014 in the Roma population. Nor was there a reduction in inequalities in health concerning the general population in Spain. Also, there was no reduction in the health inequalities by gender for the two populations.

The Lancet Public Health,2022,"Clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of hospital-based strategies for addressing the US opioid epidemic: a modelling study","Background: The syndemic of injection drug use and serious injection-related infections is leading to increasing mortality in the USA. Although outpatient treatment with medications for opioid use disorder reduces overdose risk and recurrent infections, hospitalisation remains common. We evaluated the clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of hospital-based strategies to address the US opioid epidemic. Methods: We developed a microsimulation model to compare the cost-effectiveness of: standard hospital care—detoxification for opioids, no addiction consult service (status quo); expanded inpatient prescribing of medications for opioid use disorder, including bridge prescriptions (ie, medication until they can see an outpatient provider) when possible (medications for opioid use disorder with bridge); implementation of addiction consult services within the hospital (addiction consult services alone); and a combined medication for opioid use disorder with addiction consult services strategy (combined). We used clinical trials and observational cohorts to inform model inputs. Outcomes were life-years, discounted costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, hospitalisations, and deaths. We did deterministic sensitivity analyses on key model inputs related to costs and sequelae of drug use and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to further address uncertainty. Findings: Among people who inject opioids in the USA, we estimated that expanding medications for opioid use disorder with bridge prescriptions would reduce hospitalisations and overdose deaths by 3·2% and 3·6%, respectively, and the combination of expanded medications with opioid use disorder along with addiction consult sevices would reduce hospitalisations and overdoses by 5·2% and 6·6%, respectively, compared with the status quo. Mean lifetime costs ranged from US$731 400 (95% credible interval 447 911–859 189 for the medications for opioid use disorder strategy) to $741 200 (470 930–868 551 for the combined strategy) per person. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per life-year gained, medications for opioid use disorder with bridge and combined strategies were cost-effective ($7600 and $14 300, respectively). A scenario that assumed ideal access to harm reduction services came to the same conclusions as the base case and our results were robust in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Interpretation: The combined interventions of expanding hospital-based prescribing of medications for opioid use disorder and implementing addiction consult services could improve life expectancy, be cost-effective, and could be the basis for a comprehensive hospital-based strategy for addressing the opioid epidemic in the USA and countries with similar opioid epidemics.

European Journal Of Epidemiology,2023,Gains in life expectancy from decreasing cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality – an analysis of 28 European countries 1995–2019,"Background: Life expectancy (LE) is an indicator of societal progress among rapidly aging populations. In recent decades, the displacement of deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer have been key drivers in further extending LE on the continent, though improvements vary markedly by country, sex, and over time. This study provides a comparative overview of the age-specific contributions of CVD and cancer to increasing LE in the 27 European Union member states, plus the U.K. Methods: Cause-by-age decompositions of national changes in LE were conducted for the years 1995–1999 and 2015–2019 based on the standard approach of multiple decrement life tables to quantify the relative impact over time. The contributions of CVD and cancer mortality changes to differences in LE were computed by sex and age for each of the 28 countries. We examine the difference between the member states before 2004 (“founding countries”) and those which accessed the EU after 2004 (“A10 countries”). Results: Among men, declines in CVD mortality in the founding countries of the EU were larger contributors to increasing LE over the last decades than malignant neoplasms: 2.26 years were gained by CVD declines versus 1.07 years for cancer, with 2.23 and 0.84 years gained in A10 countries, respectively. Among women in founding countries, 1.81 and 0.54 additional life years were attributable to CVD and cancer mortality declines, respectively, while in A10 countries, the corresponding values were 2.33 and 0.37 years. Lung and stomach cancer in men, and breast cancer in women were key drivers of gains in LE due to cancer overall, though rising mortality rates from lung cancer diminished the potential impact of increasing female LE in both EU founding (e.g., France, Spain, and Sweden) and A10 countries (e.g., Croatia, Hungary, and Slovenia), notably among cohorts aged 55–70 years. Over the 25 years, the LE gap between the two sets of countries narrowed from 6.22 to 5.59 years in men, and from 4.03 to 3.12 years for women, with diminishing female mortality from CVD as a determinative contributor. Conclusion: This study underscores the continued existence of an East-West divide in life expectancy across the EU27 + 1, evident on benchmarking the founding vs. A10 countries. In EU founding countries, continuous economic growth alongside improved health care, health promotion and protection policies have contributed to steady declines in mortality from chronic diseases, leading to increases in life expectancy. In contrast, less favourable mortality trends in the EU A10 countries indicate greater economic and health care challenges, and a failure to implement effective health policies.","['Cancer causes of death', 'Cardiovascular mortality', 'Decomposition', 'Geographical visualization', 'Life expectancy']",10.1007/s10654-023-01039-8,1,True
International Journal Of Epidemiology,2024,Longitudinal association between disability and suicide mortality in Republic of Korea,"Background: The Republic of Korea has reported the highest suicide rate globally since 2018. Previous studies have highlighted disability as a significant risk factor for suicide. However, comprehensive examination on the association between suicide mortality and severities and types of disabilities, and on how these associations vary according to sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviours and comorbidity profiles has never been performed. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of a nationally representative sample of 3 591 398 individuals subject to the health checkup provided by the Korean National Health Insurance in 2009, including individuals with (n ¼ 126 508) and without (n ¼ 3 734 890) disabilities, and followed-up until December 2021 Results: Overall, the presence of disability was associated with an increased risk of suicide mortality [hazard ratio (HR), 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30–1.47] compared to the absence of disability. This risk was more pronounced in individuals with Grade 1–3 disabilities (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.52–1.85) than those with Grade 4–6 disabilities (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.20–1.47). Among various types of disabilities, individuals with a disability associated with a mental disorder had the highest HR (HR, 4.49; 95% CI, 3.38–5.97), followed by those with visual impairment (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26–1.73), brain damage (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.18–1.79), hearing impairment (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.15–1.58) and extremity disability (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.21–1.40). Stratified analyses revealed that the suicide risk associated with disabilities was more pronounced in individuals with specific sociodemographic characteristics and health behaviours. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the need to prioritize policy efforts to address suicide mortality among people with disabilities, considering the distinct risks associated with disability types and severity.","['Disability', 'Korean National Health Insurance Data', 'retrospective cohort study', 'suicide']",10.1093/ije/dyae163,1,True
Epidemiology,2021,Effects of Hot Nights on Mortality in Southern Europe,"Background: There is strong evidence concerning the impact of heat stress on mortality, particularly from high temperatures. However, few studies to our knowledge emphasize the importance of hot nights, which may prevent necessary nocturnal rest. Objectives: In this study, we use hot-night duration and excess to predict daily cause-specific mortality in summer, using multiple cities across Southern Europe. Methods: We fitted time series regression models to summer cause-specific mortality, including natural, respiratory, and cardiovascular causes, in 11 cities across four countries. We included a distributed lag nonlinear model with lags up to 7 days for hot night duration and excess adjusted by daily mean temperature. We summarized city-specific associations as overall-cumulative exposure-response curves at the country level using meta-analysis. Results: We found positive but generally nonlinear associations between relative risk (RR) of cause-specific mortality and duration and excess of hot nights. RR of duration associated with nonaccidental mortality in Portugal was 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07, 1.54); other associations were imprecise, but we also found positive city-specific estimates for Rome and Madrid. Risk of hot-night excess ranged from 1.12 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.20) for France to 1.37 (95% CI = 1.26, 1.48) for Portugal. Risk estimates for excess were consistently higher than for duration. Conclusions: This study provides new evidence that, over a wider range of locations, hot night indices are strongly associated with cause-specific deaths. Modeling the impact of thermal characteristics during summer nights on mortality could improve decisionmaking for preventive public health strategies.","['Climate change', 'Hot nights', 'Human health', 'Mortality', 'Tropical nights']",10.1097/EDE.0000000000001359,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2022,Early physical maturation and subjective health complaints in adolescent girls: A pooled cross-sectional analysis,"Background Although adolescents are generally healthy, subjective health complaints (SHC) are common in this age group, especially in adolescent girls. We explored the association between early menarche and the frequency of psychosomatic symptoms and how this association varies between countries. Methods Our sample included 298 000 adolescent girls from 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014 cycles of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study in 41 European and North American countries. School surveys measured the frequency of eight psychosomatic symptoms in the past 6 months. Early maturation was defined as self-reported age at menarche below 11 years. Using logistic regression, we estimated adjusted ORs (aORs) and 95% CIsof experiencing each psychosomatic symptom at least more than once a week and experiencing two or more symptoms at least more than once a week. Results Early menarche occurred in 4.73% of the sample and was positively related to headache, stomachache, backache, feeling low, irritability or bad temper, feeling nervous, difficulties in sleeping, feeling dizzy and two or more of these symptoms, respectively (all p values<0.001). The interactions between early menarche and survey circle were non-significant. Changing the age criterion to 12 years did not affect the results. The associations between early menarche and psychosomatic symptoms were robust across the HBSC-participating counties with two age criteria. Conclusions Early menarche positively relates to various psychosomatic symptoms in European and North American adolescent girls. Our findings suggest that early-maturing girls may need early supportive interventions.","['accidents', 'health promotion', 'low back pain', 'public health', 'social sciences']",10.1136/jech-2022-219547,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2020,Prevalence and adverse obstetric outcomes of female genital mutilation among women in rural Northern Ghana,"Background: Female genital mutilation (FGM) is commonly practiced in sub-Saharan Africa and results in adverse pregnancy outcomes among affected women. This paper assessed the prevalence and effects of FGM on pregnancy outcomes in a rural Ghanaian setting. Methods: We analyzed 9306 delivery records between 2003 and 2013 from the Navrongo War Memorial Hospital. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the effects of FGM on pregnancy outcomes such as stillbirth, birth weight, postpartum haemorrhage, caesarean and instrumental delivery. We also assessed differences in the duration of stay in the hospital by FGM status. Results: A greater proportion of mothers with FGM (24.7%) were older than 35 years compared with those without FGM (7.6%). FGM declined progressively from 28.4% in 2003 to 0.6% in 2013. Mothers with FGM were nearly twice as likely to have caesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratios = 1.85 with 95%CI [1.72, 1.99]) and stillbirths (1.60 [1.21, 2.11]) compared with those without. Similarly, they had a 4-fold increased risk of post-partum haemorrhage (4.69 [3.74, 5.88]) and more than 2-fold risk lacerations/episiotomy (2.57 [1.86, 3.21]) during delivery. Average duration of stay in the hospital was higher for mothers with FGM from 2003 to 2007. Conclusions: Despite significant decline in prevalence of FGM, adverse obstetric outcomes are still high among affected women. Increased public health education of circumcised women on these outcomes would help improve institutional deliveries and heighten awareness and prompt clinical decisions among healthcare workers. Further scale-up of community level interventions are required to completely eliminate FGM.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckz195,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2023,Incarceration History and Health Insurance and Coverage Changes in the U.S.,"Introduction: This study examines the association of incarceration history and health insurance coverage and coverage changes in the U.S. Methods: Individuals with and without incarceration history were identified from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 with follow-up through 2017–2018 (n=7,417). Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations between incarceration history and health insurance and coverage changes in the past 12 months. This study also assessed variation in associations by incarceration duration, frequency, and recency and reoffence history. Analysis was conducted in 2022. Results: Individuals with incarceration history were more likely to be uninsured (AOR=1.69; 95% CI=1.55, 1.85) and to experience year-long uninsurance (AOR=1.34; 95% CI=1.12, 1.59) and were less likely to have stable health insurance coverage (AOR=1.30; 95% CI=1.08, 1.56) than individuals without incarceration history. Longer duration and more frequent incarcerations were associated with a higher likelihood of lack of and unstable insurance coverage and year-long uninsurance. Conclusions: People with an incarceration history had worse access to health insurance coverage.

European Journal Of Epidemiology,2021,Ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality during the first two waves of the Coronavirus Pandemic: a nationwide cohort study of 29 million adults in England,"Ethnic minorities have experienced disproportionate COVID-19 mortality rates in the UK and many other countries. We compared the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death between ethnic groups in the first and second waves the of COVID-19 pandemic in England. We also investigated whether the factors explaining differences in COVID-19 death between ethnic groups changed between the two waves. Using data from the Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset, a linked dataset combining the 2011 Census with primary care and hospital records and death registrations, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24th January 2020 until 31st August 2020) and ﻿the first part of the second wave (from 1st September to 28th December 2020). We estimated age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) in the two waves stratified by ethnic groups and sex. We also estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic-minority groups compared with the White British population, adjusted for geographical factors, socio-demographic characteristics, and pre-pandemic health conditions. The study population included over 28.9 million individuals aged 30–100 years living in private households. In the first wave, all ethnic minority groups had a higher risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the risk of COVID-19 death remained elevated for people from Pakistani (ASMR: 339.9 [95% CI: 303.7–376.2] and 166.8 [141.7–191.9] deaths per 100,000 population in men and women) and Bangladeshi (318.7 [247.4–390.1] and 127.1 [91.1–171.3] in men and women) background but not for people from Black ethnic groups. Adjustment for geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave but not in the second wave. Despite an attenuation of the elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and health status, the risk was substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background in both the first and the second waves. Between the first and second waves of the pandemic, the reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group shows that ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality can be addressed. The continued higher rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy changes.","['COVID-19', 'Ethnicity', 'Mortality']",10.1007/s10654-021-00765-1,1,True
The Lancet Public Health,2023,"Population health outcomes in South Korea 1990–2019, and projections up to 2040: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019","Background: South Korea has one of the longest operating universal health coverage (UHC) systems. A comprehensive analysis of long-term trajectories of morbidity and mortality in the South Korean population after the inception of UHC is needed to inform health-care policy and practice. Methods: We used data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019 to present estimates of cause-specific mortality, incidence, prevalence, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in South Korea from 1990 to 2019. We also examined forecasted estimates of YLLs up to 2040 to investigate likely future changes in disease burden. Finally, we evaluated GBD estimates from seven comparator countries to place disease burden in South Korea within a broader context. Findings: Age-standardised DALYs related to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) decreased by 43·6% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 39·4–47·9) and mortality by 58·8% (55·9–60·5) from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, the ratio of male to female age-standardised rates of YLLs in South Korea was higher than the global average for 75·9% (22 of 29 diseases) of leading causes, indicating a disproportional disease burden on males in South Korea. Among risk factors, tobacco use accounted for the highest number of 2019 deaths (44 470 [95% UI 37 432–53 989]) in males and high systolic blood pressure for the highest number (21 014 [15 553–26 723]) in females. Among the top ten leading causes of YLLs forecast in South Korea in 2040, nine were NCDs, for both males and females. Interpretation: Our report shows a positive landscape of population health outcomes in South Korea following the establishment of UHC. However, due in part to the effects of population ageing driving up medical expenditures for NCDs, financial pressures and sustainability challenges associated with UHC are pressing concerns. Policy makers should work to tackle population ageing and allocate resources efficiently by prioritising interventions that address the leading causes of death and disability identified in this study.

American Journal Of Epidemiology,2023,Impact of Reversion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Immunoreactivity Tests on the Estimated Annual Risk of Tuberculosis Infection,"A key metric in tuberculosis epidemiology is the annual risk of infection (ARI), which is usually derived from tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γrelease assay (IGRA) prevalence surveys carried out in children. Derivation of the ARI assumes that immunoreactivity is persistent over time; however, reversion of immunoreactivity has long been documented. We used a deterministic, compartmental model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection to explore the impact of reversion on ARI estimation using age-specific reversion probabilities for the TST and IGRA. Using empirical data on TST reversion (22.2%/year for persons aged ≤19 years), the true ARI was 2-5 times higher than that estimated from immunoreactivity studies in children aged 8-12 years. Applying empirical reversion probabilities for the IGRA (9.9%/year for youths aged 12-18 years) showed a 1.5- to 2-fold underestimation. ARIs are increasingly underestimated in older populations, due to the cumulative impact of reversion on population reactivity over time. Declines in annual risk did not largely affect the results. Ignoring reversion leads to a stark underestimation of the true ARI in populations and our interpretation of Mtb transmission intensity. In future surveys, researchers should adjust for the reversion probability and its cumulative effect with increasing age to obtain a more accurate reflection of the burden and dynamics of Mtb infection.","['interferon-γrelease assay', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission', 'TST/IGRA surveys', 'tuberculin skin test', 'tuberculosis']",10.1093/aje/kwad028,1,True
European Journal Of Epidemiology,2021,COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pregnant women and mothers of young children: results of a survey in 16 countries,"With the development of multiple effective vaccines, reducing the global morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 will depend on the distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Estimates of global vaccine acceptance among pregnant women and mothers of young children are yet unknown. An understanding of the challenges and correlates to vaccine acceptance will aid the acceleration of vaccine administration within these populations. Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women and mothers of children younger than 18-years-old, as well as potential predictors, were assessed through an online survey, administered by Pregistry between October 28 and November 18, 2020. 17,871 total survey responses from 16 countries were obtained. Given a 90% COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, 52.0% of pregnant women (n = 2747/5282) and 73.4% of non-pregnant women (n = 9214/12,562) indicated an intention to receive the vaccine. 69.2% of women (n = 11,800/17,054), both pregnant and non-pregnant, indicated an intention to vaccinate their children. Vaccine acceptance was generally highest in India, the Philippines, and all sampled countries in Latin America; it was lowest in Russia, the United States and Australia. The strongest predictors of vaccine acceptance included confidence in vaccine safety or effectiveness, worrying about COVID-19, belief in the importance of vaccines to their own country, compliance to mask guidelines, trust of public health agencies/health science, as well as attitudes towards routine vaccines. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and its predictors among women vary globally. Vaccination campaigns for women and children should be specific for each country in order to attain the largest impact.","['COVID-19', 'Pregnancy', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine acceptance', 'Vaccine confidence']",10.1007/s10654-021-00728-6,1,True

However, as of February 2022, the policy remained to be implemented. Cross-sectional data come from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Brazil Wave 3 Survey among adult smokers (N = 1216) in 2016–2017. The majority of smokers supported a ban on menthol (56.0%; 95%CI: 51.7–60.2%) and a ban on all additives (61.7%; 57.5–65.8%), with no significant differences across sociodemographic groups in adjusted logistic regression models. More than half of menthol smokers reported they would either quit or reduce the amount they smoked if menthol cigarettes were banned. Findings suggest that there is support for Brazil's ban on flavour additives, which is a determinant of successful policy implemented.

Epidemiology's capabilities have advanced remarkably in recent decades, although research gaps have appeared during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.Epidemiology's social contract reflecting a dual commitment to science and health could arguably be entirely met by producing research results under conditions variously described as objective, impartial, neutral, or independent and handing such results to decision makers and the public at large. However, a closer examination shows that those four terms address sharply distinct issues, with distinct practical implications, and that the epidemiologist responsibility is de facto involved beyond providing research results.

Epidemiology,2024,PROVIDENT: Development and Validation of a Machine Learning Model to Predict Neighborhood-level Overdose Risk in Rhode Island,"Background: Drug overdose persists as a leading cause of death in the United States, but resources to address it remain limited. As a result, health authorities must consider where to allocate scarce resources within their jurisdictions. Machine learning offers a strategy to identify areas with increased future overdose risk to proactively allocate overdose prevention resources. This modeling study is embedded in a randomized trial to measure the effect of proactive resource allocation on statewide overdose rates in Rhode Island (RI). Methods: We used statewide data from RI from 2016 to 2020 to developanensemblemachinelearningmodelpredictingneighborhoodlevel fatal overdose risk. Our ensemble model integrated gradient boosting machine and super learner base models in a moving window framework to make predictions in 6-month intervals. Our performance target, developed a priori with the RI Department of Health, was to identify the 20% of RI neighborhoods containing at least 40% of statewide overdose deaths, including at least one neighborhood per municipality. The model was validated after trial launch. Results: Our model selected priority neighborhoods capturing 40.2% of statewide overdose deaths during the test periods and 44.1% of statewide overdose deaths during validation periods. Our ensemble outperformed the base models during the test periods and performed comparably to the best-performing base model during the validation periods. Conclusions: We demonstrated the capacity for machine learning models to predict neighborhood-level fatal overdose risk to a degree of accuracy suitable for practitioners.

Methods The study comprised data on 3712 women and 2488 men in the Norwegian HUNT study who reported chronic LBP at baseline in 1995-1997. A modified Poisson regression model was used to calculate adjusted risk ratios (RRs) for the probability of recovery from chronic LBP at follow-up in 2006-2008, associated with sleep problems and co-occurring musculoskeletal pain at baseline. Results Compared with persons without sleeplessness, persons who often/always experienced sleeplessness had a lower probability of recovery from chronic LBP (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.74 in women and RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.95 in men). Although there was no clear evidence of statistical interaction between sleeplessness and co-occurring musculoskeletal pain, women and men who often/always experienced sleeplessness and had ≥5 additional chronic pain sites had RRs of recovery of 0.40 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.48) and 0.59 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.78), respectively, compared with persons without sleeplessness and 1-2 chronic pain sites. Conclusion These findings suggest that preventing or reducing sleep problems among people with chronic LBP may have the potential of improving the long-Term prognosis of this condition, also among those with several additional pain sites.","['epidemiology', 'epidemiology of chronic diseases', 'longitudinal studies', 'low back pain', 'sleep']",10.1136/jech-2019-212734,1,True

Preventive Medicine,2022,The influence of civic associations and exposure to ideological heterogeneity on public views on mask wearing and social distancing,"Mask wearing and social distancing have been essential public health guidelines throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but faced resistance from skeptical subgroups in the United States, including Republicans and evangelicals. We examined the effects of participation in ideologically heterogeneous civic associations on attitudes toward public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among partisan and religious subgroups most resistant to public health guidelines. We analyzed panel survey data from a nationally representative cohort of 1222 U.S. adults collected in April, July, and November 2020, and July/August 2021. Data on the importance of social distancing and mask wearing were collected in November 2020. Evangelicals and Republicans who participated in ideologically diverse civic associations were more likely to support mask wearing compared to those participating in ideologically homogenous associations (difference in predicted policy support on a 0–1 scale: 0.084, p ≤.05 and 0.020, p ≤.05, respectively). Evangelicals in ideologically diverse associations were also more likely to support social distancing compared to those in ideologically homogenous associations (0.089, p ≤.05). Participation in civic associations with ideologically heterogeneous members was associated with greater support for public health measures among skeptical subgroups.

The purpose of this study was to assess the volume and variation of Dutch low-value care practices. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with data of a Dutch healthcare insurance company from general practioners (GP’s) and hospitals in the Netherlands from 2016. We used all billing claims made by healthcare providers of 3.5 million Dutch inhabitants. We studied Choosing Wisely recommendations in order to select low-value care practices. We used the percentage low-value care practices per hospital and number of low-value care practices per GP as outcomes. Results: We assessed the volume of low-back imaging by GPs, screening of patients over 75 years for colorectal cancer and diagnosing varices with Doppler or Plethysmography. We found that 0.4% (range 0–7%) of the eligible patients received low-value screening for colorectal cancer and 8.0% (range 0–88%) of eligible patients received low-value diagnosing of varices. About 52.4% of the GPs ordered X-rays and 11.2% ordered magnetic resonance imagings of the lumbosacral spine. Most healthcare providers did not provide the measured low-value care practices. However, 1 in 12 GPs ordered at least one low-back X-ray a week. Conclusions: The three Choosing Wisely recommendations showed a lot of practice variation; many healthcare providers did not order these low-value diagnostic tests; a minor part did order a substantial amount, low-back spine radiology in particular. These healthcare providers should start reducing these activities.",[],10.1093/EURPUB/CKZ245,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2023,Impact of mental disorders during education on work participation: A register-based longitudinal study on young adults with 10 years follow-up,"Background Mental disorders are a leading cause of disability and a major threat to work participation in young adults. This register-based longitudinal study aims to investigate the influence of mental disorders on entering and exiting paid employment among young graduates and to explore differences across socioeconomic groups. Methods Register information on sociodemographics (age, sex, migration background) and employment status of 2 346 393 young adults who graduated from secondary vocational (n=1 004 395) and higher vocational education or university (n=1 341 998) in the period 2010-2019 was provided by Statistics Netherlands. This information was enriched with register information on the prescription of nervous system medication for mental disorders in the year before graduation as a proxy for having a mental disorder. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the influence of mental disorders on (A) entering paid employment among all graduates and (B) exiting from paid employment among graduates who had entered paid employment. Results Individuals with mental disorders were less likely to enter (HR 0.69-0.70) and more likely to exit paid employment (HR 1.41-1.42). Individuals using antipsychotics were the least likely to enter (HR 0.44) and the most likely to exit paid employment (HR 1.82-1.91), followed by those using hypnotics and sedatives. The association between mental disorders and work participation was found across socioeconomic subgroups (ie, educational level, sex and migration background). Discussion Young adults with mental disorders are less likely to enter and maintain paid employment. These results ask for prevention of mental disorders and for a more inclusive labour market.","['DEPRESSION', 'ETHNIC GROUPS', 'MENTAL HEALTH', 'OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH', 'UNEMPLOYMENT']",10.1136/jech-2022-219487,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2022,Natural history of mental health competence from childhood to adolescence,"Background Mental health competence (MHC) involves psychosocial capabilities such as regulating emotions, interacting well with peers and caring for others, and predicts a range of health and social outcomes. This study examines the course of MHC from childhood to adolescence and patterning by gender and disadvantage, in Australian and UK contexts. Methods Data: Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n=4983) and the Millennium Cohort Study (n=18 296). Measures: A measure capturing key aspects of MHC was derived summing items from the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, assessed at 4–5 years, 6–7 years, 10–11 years and 14–15 years. Analysis: Proportions of children with high MHC (scores ≥23 of range 8–24) were estimated by age and country. Random-effects models were used to define MHC trajectories according to baseline MHC and change over time. Sociodemographic patterns were described. Results The prevalence of high MHC steadily increased from 4 years to 15 years (from 13.6% to 15.8% and 20.6% to 26.2% in Australia and the UK, respectively). Examination of trajectories revealed that pathways of some children diverge from this normative MHC progression. For example, 7% and 9% of children in Australia and the UK, respectively, had a low starting point and decreased further in MHC by mid-adolescence. At all ages, and over time, MHC was lower for boys compared with girls and for children from disadvantaged compared with advantaged family backgrounds. Conclusions Approaches to promoting MHC require a sustained focus from the early years through to adolescence, with more intensive approaches likely needed to support disadvantaged groups and boys.",[],10.1136/jech-2021-216761,1,True
American Journal Of Preventive Medicine,2024,Swipe to Inhale: Tobacco-Related Content on Social Media and Susceptibility to Tobacco Use,"Introduction: Research has linked youth exposure and engagement with tobacco-related content on social media to behavioral changes; however, there is a lack of studies exploring the source and types of such content and their impact on youth's susceptibility to tobacco use. This study examined the association between the type and source of content posted on social media and susceptibility to tobacco use, defined as curiosity or intention to use tobacco or e-cigarettes. Methods: Data were from the Population Assessment Tobacco and Health study, a nationally representative cohort study of U.S. youth (n=5,652). This analysis conducted in March 2024, focused on Wave 6 (2021), examining youth who used social media in the past month and did not use cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the associations. Results: Of the youth who had used social media in the past month (88.7%), 61.4% had encountered tobacco-related content. Exposure to such content was associated with greater susceptibility to e-cigarette use (OR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.38–1.62) and cigarette use (OR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.17–1.43). Daily or near-daily exposure to tobacco-related content compared to non-exposed respondents was associated with greater odds of susceptibility to tobacco use (OR=1.53, 95% CI: 1.37–1.71). Only posts made by celebrities and influencers were associated with a greater susceptibility to tobacco use. Conclusions: Regular exposure to tobacco-related content on social media, particularly content shared by celebrities and social media influencers, was associated with susceptibility to tobacco use. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the effects of social media influencers on youth.",[],10.1016/j.amepre.2024.07.020,1,True
International Journal Of Epidemiology,2021,"Social inequalities and COVID-19 mortality in the city of Saõ Paulo, Brazil","Background: Heterogeneity in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is often associated with a country's health-services structure and social inequality. This study aimed to characterize social inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in Saõ Paulo, the most populous city in Brazil and Latin America. Methods: We conducted a population-based study, including COVID-19 deaths among Saõ Paulo residents from March to September 2020. Age-standardized mortality rates and unadjusted rate ratios (RRs) [with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] were estimated by race, sex, age group, district of residence, household crowding, educational attainment, income level and percentage of households in subnormal areas in each district. Time trends in mortality were assessed using the Joinpoint model. Results: Males presented an 84% increase in COVID-19 mortality compared with females (RR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.79-1.90). Higher mortality rates were observed for Blacks (RR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.67-1.88) and mixed (RR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.37-1.47) compared with Whites, whereas lower mortality was noted for Asians (RR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.58-0.68). A positive gradient was found for all socio-economic indicators, i.e. increases in disparities denoted by less education, more household crowding, lower income and a higher concentration of subnormal areas were associated with higher mortality rates. A decrease in mortality over time was observed in all racial groups, but it started earlier among Whites and Asians. Conclusion: Our results reveal striking social inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in Saõ Paulo, exposing structural inequities in Brazilian society that were not addressed by the governmental response to COVID-19. Without an equitable response, COVID-19 will further exacerbate current social inequalities in Saõ Paulo.","['COVID-19', 'mortality', 'race factors', 'social determinants of health']",10.1093/ije/dyab022,1,True
International Journal Of Epidemiology,2023,Worth the paper it's written on- A cross-sectional study of Medical Certificate of Stillbirth accuracy in the UK,"Background: The Medical Certificate of Stillbirth (MCS) records data about a baby's death after 24 weeks of gestation but before birth. Major errors that could alter interpretation of the MCS were widespread in two UK-based regional studies. Methods: A multicentre evaluation was conducted, examining MCS issued 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 in 76 UK obstetric units. A systematic case-note review of stillbirths was conducted by Obstetric and Gynaecology trainees, generating individual 'ideal MCSs' and comparing these to the actual MCS issued. Anonymized central data analysis described rates and types of error, agreement and factors associated with major errors. Results: There were 1120 MCSs suitable for assessment, with 126 additional submitted data sets unsuitable for accuracy analysis (total 1246 cases). Gestational age demonstrated 'substantial' agreement [K = 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.76)]. Primary cause of death (COD) showed 'fair' agreement [K = 0.26 (95% CI 0.24-0.29)]. Major errors [696/1120; 62.1% (95% CI 59.3-64.9%)] included certificates issued for fetal demise at <24 weeks' gestation [23/696; 3.3% (95% CI 2.2-4.9%)] or neonatal death [2/696; 0.3% (95% CI 0.1-1.1%)] or incorrect primary COD [667/696; 95.8% (95% CI 94.1-97.1%)]. Of 540/1246 [43.3% (95% CI 40.6-46.1%)] 'unexplained' stillbirths, only 119/540 [22.0% (95% CI 18.8-25.7%)] remained unexplained; the majority were redesignated as either fetal growth restriction [FGR: 195/540; 36.1% (95% CI 32.2-40.3%)] or placental insufficiency [184/540; 34.1% (95% CI 30.2-38.2)]. Overall, FGR [306/1246; 24.6% (95% CI 22.3-27.0%)] was the leading primary COD after review, yet only 53/306 [17.3% (95% CI 13.5-22.1%)] FGR cases were originally attributed correctly. Conclusion: This study demonstrates widespread major errors in MCS completion across the UK. MCS should only be completed following structured case-note review, with particular attention on the fetal growth trajectory.","['accuracy', 'cause of death', 'death certification', 'fetal growth restriction', 'perinatal death', 'placental insufficiency', 'Stillbirth', 'stillbirth certification']",10.1093/ije/dyac100,1,True
European Journal Of Epidemiology,2020,Genetic instrumental variable analysis: time to call mendelian randomization what it is. The example of alcohol and cardiovascular disease,"In recent years, epidemiologists have increasingly sought to employ genetic data to identify ‘causal’ relationships between exposures of interest and various endpoints – an instrumental variable approach sometimes termed Mendelian randomization. However, this approach is subject to all of the limitations of instrumental variable analysis and to several limitations specific to its genetic underpinnings, including confounding, weak instrument bias, pleiotropy, adaptation, and failure of replication. Although the approach enjoys some utility in testing the etiological role of discrete biochemical pathways, like folate metabolism, examples like that of alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease demonstrate that it must be treated with all of the circumspection that should accompany all forms of observational epidemiology. Going forward, we urge the elimination of randomization or causality in reports of its use and suggest that Mendelian randomization instead be termed exactly what it is – genetic instrumental variable analysis.","['Alcohol Drinking', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Folic Acid', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Mendelian Randomization Analysis']",10.1007/s10654-019-00578-3,1,True
Preventive Medicine,2022,The contribution of potentially modifiable risk factors to acute ischemic stroke burden - Comparing young and older adults,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. In order to estimate the contribution of five modifiable risk factors to acute ischemic stroke (AIS) incidence in Israel, we conducted a case-control study based on first AIS cases aged 21–90 reported to the Israeli National Stroke Registry during 2014–2015, and controls from a national health survey conducted between 2013 and 2015. We calculated the population attributable risk (PAR) of each risk factor and the combined PAR for all risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, current smoking, obesity and hyperlipidemia), in all study population and by subgroups of young adults (age < 55) and older adults (age ≥ 55). The final analysis included 571, 577 and 500 matched pairs for all study population, young adults and older adults, respectively. Among young adults, current smoking and hypertension were the two most contributing risk factors for AIS, accounting for 33.6% (95% CI 27.3–39.9) and 28.9% (95% CI 22.1–35.7) of AIS cases, respectively. Among older adults, hypertension was the single most contributing risk factor for AIS and diabetes was the second most contributing risk factor for AIS, accounting for 64.9% (95% CI 57.3–72.5) and 25.7% (95% CI 17.5–33.9) of AIS cases, respectively. The combined PAR was significantly lower among young adults (PAR = 67.9%), compared with older adults (PAR = 80.7%). The combined PAR for all study population was 80.1% (95% CI 74.0–86.2), indicating that five common and modifiable risk factors explain ~80% of AIS incidence in Israel. Primary prevention strategies targeting these risk factors have the potential to drastically reduce stroke related morbidity and mortality.","['Case-control study', 'Ischemic stroke', 'Population attributable risk (PAR)', 'Risk factors', 'Young adults']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106933,1,True
Epidemiology,2022,Short-term exposure to air pollution and attributable risk of kidney diseases,"Background: Several studies have shown that long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with reduced kidney function. However, less is known about effects of short-term exposure to air pollution on kidney disease aggravation and resultant emergency room (ER) burden. This study aimed to estimate excess ER visits attributable to short-term air pollution and to provide evidence relevant to air pollution standards to protect kidney patients. Methods: We conducted time-series analysis using National Health Insurance data covering all persons in South Korea (2003-2013). We collected daily data for air pollutants (particulate matter ≤10 μm [PM10], ozone [O3], carbon monoxide [CO], and sulfur dioxide [SO2]) and ER visits for total kidney and urinary system disease, acute kidney injury (AKI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We performed a two-stage time-series analysis to estimate excess ER visits attributable to air pollution by first calculating estimates for each of 16 regions, and then generating an overall estimate. Results: For all kidney and urinary disease (902, 043 cases), excess ER visits attributable to air pollution existed for all pollutants studied. For AKI (76, 330 cases), we estimated the highest impact on excess ER visits from O3, while for CKD (210, 929 cases), the impacts of CO and SO2 were the highest. The associations between air pollution and kidney ER visits existed for days with air pollution concentrations below current World Health Organization guidelines. Conclusion: This study provides quantitative estimates of ER burdens attributable to air pollution. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that stricter air quality standards benefit kidney patients.","['Acute kidney injury', 'Air pollution', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Emergency room visit', 'Kidney disease', 'Short-term exposure', 'WHO air quality guidelines']",10.1097/EDE.0000000000001430,1,True
Epidemiology,2024,Geospatial Data Aggregation Methods for Novel Geographies: Validating Congressional District Life Expectancy Estimates,"Background: Place is a critical determinant of health. Recent novel analyses have explored health outcome estimation for small geographies, such as census tracts, as well as health outcome aggregation to geopolitical geographies with accountable political representatives, such as congressional districts. In one such application, combining these approaches, researchers aggregated census tract estimates of life expectancy to the congressional district level to derive local estimates, but such an approach has not been validated. Methods: Here, we compared two sources and approaches to calculating life expectancy data for Pennsylvania congressional districts. We used 2010-2015 census tract life expectancy estimates from the US Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project (LEEP) and dasymetric methods to compute population-weighted life expectancy aggregated to the congressional district level. Using georeferenced Vital Statistics data, we aggregated age-specific census tract death and population counts to congressional districts and used abridged life tables to estimate life expectancy. To validate the dasymetric aggregated estimates we compared absolute differences, assessed the correlation, and created Bland-Altman plots to visualize the agreement between the two measures. Results: We found strong agreement between congressional district estimates of life expectancy at birth derived using the dasymetric LEEP model-based approach and Vital Statistics direct estimates approach, though life expectancy at older ages (75 and older) showed weak correlations. Conclusion: This validation contributes to our understanding of geospatial aggregation methods for novel geographies including congressional districts. Health outcome data aggregated to the congressional district geography can support congressional policy making aimed at improving population health outcomes.","['congressional district', 'dasymetric', 'geopolitical geography', 'geospatial', 'life expectancy']",10.1097/EDE.0000000000001797,1,True
Journal Of Epidemiology And Community Health,2021,Socioeconomic gaps over time in colorectal cancer survival in England: flexible parametric survival analysis,"Background: Despite persistent reports of socioeconomic inequalities in colorectal cancer survival in England, the magnitude of survival differences has not been fully evaluated. Methods: Patients diagnosed with colon cancer (n=68 169) and rectal cancer (n=38 267) in England (diagnosed between January 2010 and March 2013) were analysed as a retrospective cohort study using the National Cancer Registry data linked with other population-based healthcare records. The flexible parametric model incorporating time-varying covariates was used to assess the difference in excess hazard of death and in net survival between the most affluent and the most deprived groups over time. Results: Survival analyses showed a clear pattern by deprivation. Hazard ratio of death was consistently higher in the most deprived group than the least deprived for both colon and rectal cancer, ranging from 1.08 to 1.17 depending on the model. On the net survival scale, the socioeconomic gap between the most and the least deprived groups reached approximately -4% at the maximum (-3.7%, 95% CI -1.6 to -5.7% in men, -3.6%, 95% CI -1.6 to -5.7% in women) in stages III for colon and approximately -2% (-2.3%, 95% CI -0.2 to -4.5% in men, -2.3%, 95% CI -0.2 to -4.3% in women) in stage II for rectal cancer at 3 years from diagnosis, after controlling for age, emergency presentation, receipt of resection and comorbidities. The gap was smaller in other stages and sites. For both cancers, patients with emergency presentation persistently had a higher excess hazard of death than those without emergency presentation. Conclusion: Survival disparities were profound particularly among patients in the stages, which benefit from appropriate and timely treatment. For the patients with emergency presentation, excess hazard of death remained high throughout three years from the diagnosis. Public health measures should be taken to reduce access inequalities to improve survival disparities.",[],10.1136/jech-2021-216754,1,True
International Journal Of Epidemiology,2021,Antidepressants and risk of sudden sensorineural hearing loss: A population-based cohort study,"Background: Increasing numbers of animal studies have found that sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is related to the mechanism of serotonergic modulation. However, the relationship between antidepressants and SSNHL is unclear in humans. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the association between antidepressant use and risk of SSNHL. Methods: Data from 218 466 antidepressant users and 1 116 518 nonusers were obtained from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. We used propensity-score matching (PSM) and inverse-probability treatment weighting (IPTW) to eliminate any bias. Each patient was tracked for 5 years to ascertain whether or not they were diagnosed with SSNHL. Cox proportional-hazard regression analyses were performed to calculate the SSNHL risk. Results: The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of SSNHL for antidepressant users was 1.36 compared with nonusers in the full cohort study. The aHR for antidepressant users was 1.44 and 1.49 compared with the nonusers in the IPTW and PSM cohorts, respectively. All classes of antidepressants consistently increased the SSNHL risk. Additionally, patients receiving four classes of antidepressants were associated with a much higher SSNHL risk (aHR, 2.05) and those receiving one or two classes of antidepressants had a relatively lower SSNHL risk. Conclusion: Antidepressants increased SSNHL risk, regardless of their class. Furthermore, patients who took a higher number of antidepressant classes showed an increased risk of developing SSNHL than those who took a lower number of antidepressant classes. Therefore, physicians should estimate the risks and benefits of antidepressant use and avoid prescribing antidepressants concurrently.","['Antidepressant', 'Depression', 'Hearing', 'Safety', 'Sudden sensorineural hearing loss']",10.1093/ije/dyab023,1,True
European Journal Of Public Health,2021,Occupational class and employment sector differences in common mental disorders: A longitudinal Swedish cohort study,"Background: Recent increases in common mental disorders (CMDs) among young adults are of great concern although studies of CMDs in young employees are sparse. This study investigated the independent and interacting effects of sector of employment, occupational class and CMDs. Additionally, associations between type of employment branch and CMDs within each sector were examined. Methods: This population-based longitudinal cohort study included 665 138 employees, 19 29 years, residing in Sweden in 2009. Employment sector (i.e. private/public) and occupational class (non-manual/manual workers) were measured in 2009. Risk estimates of CMDs, measured as new prescription of antidepressants and/or psychiatric care with a diagnosis of CMDs, between 2010 and 2016, were calculated as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using Cox multivariable regression analysis. Results: Public sector employees (whereof 60% manual workers) had an elevated risk for CMDs compared to private sector employees [adjusted HR: 1.14 (95% CI 1.12 1.16)]. Within each sector, manual workers were at increased risk of CMDs compared to non-manual workers. There was an interaction between sector of employment and occupational class; manual workers in the public sector had the highest CMD risk [adjusted synergy index: 1.51 (95% CI 1.29 1.76)]. The most elevated risk for CMDs was observed in those employed in health and social services and the lowest risk among construction workers. Conclusion: Sector of employment and occupational class play a role in CMDs in young employees. These findings should be taken into account in the attempts to reduce CMDs in the young working population.",[],10.1093/eurpub/ckab091,1,True
American Journal Of Epidemiology,2023,"Moving Toward Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable Practices in Epidemiologic Research","Data sharing is essential for reproducibility of epidemiologic research, replication of findings, pooled analyses in consortia efforts, and maximizing study value to address multiple research questions. However, barriers related to confidentiality, costs, and incentives often limit the extent and speed of data sharing. Epidemiological practices that follow Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) principles can address these barriers by making data resources findable with the necessary metadata, accessible to authorized users, and interoperable with other data, to optimize the reuse of resources with appropriate credit to its creators. We provide an overview of these principles and describe approaches for implementation in epidemiology. Increasing degrees of FAIRness can be achieved by moving data and code from on-site locations to remote, accessible (""Cloud"") data servers, using machine-readable and nonproprietary files, and developing open-source code. Adoption of these practices will improve daily work and collaborative analyses and facilitate compliance with data sharing policies from funders and scientific journals. Achieving a high degree of FAIRness will require funding, training, organizational support, recognition, and incentives for sharing research resources, both data and code. However, these costs are outweighed by the benefits of making research more reproducible, impactful, and equitable by facilitating the reuse of precious research resources by the scientific community.","['accessibility', 'data sharing', 'epidemiology', 'FAIR', 'interoperability', 'reproducibility']",10.1093/aje/kwad040,1,True
The Lancet Public Health,2023,Psychiatric disorders and reoffending risk in individuals with community sentences in Sweden: a national cohort study,"Background: Community sentences are widely used in many countries, often comprising the majority of criminal justice sanctions. Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent in community-sentenced populations and are thus potential targets for treatment interventions designed to reduce reoffending. We examined the association between psychiatric disorders and reoffending in a national cohort of individuals given community sentences in Sweden, with use of a sibling control design to account for unmeasured familial confounding. Methods: We did a longitudinal cohort study of 82 415 individuals given community sentences between Nov 1, 1991, and Dec 31, 2013, in Sweden using data from population-based registers. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for any reoffending and violent reoffending with Cox regression models. We compared community-sentenced siblings with and without psychiatric disorders to control for potential familial confounding. Additionally, we calculated population attributable fractions to assess the contribution of psychiatric disorders to reoffending behaviours. The primary outcomes of the study were any (general) reoffending and violent reoffending. Findings: Between Nov 1, 1991, and Dec 31, 2013, those given community sentences who were diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder had an increased reoffending risk in men (adjusted HR 1·59, 95% CI 1·56–1·63 for any reoffending; 1·60, 1·54–1·66 for violent reoffending) and women (1·71, 1·61–1·82 for any reoffending; 2·19, 1·88–2·54 for violent reoffending). Risk estimates remained elevated after adjustment for familial confounding. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders, personality disorders, and substance use disorders had stronger associations with violent reoffending than did other psychiatric disorders. Assuming causality, the adjusted population attributable risk of psychiatric disorders on violent reoffending was 8·3% (95% CI 6·6–10·0) in the first 2 years of community follow-up in men and 30·9% (22·7–39·0) in women. Interpretation: Psychiatric disorders were associated with an increased risk of any reoffending and violent reoffending in the community-sentenced population. The magnitude of the association between psychiatric disorders and reoffending varied by individual diagnosis. Substance use disorders had the highest absolute and relative risks. Most of the increased risk for any reoffending in individuals with psychiatric disorders could be attributed to comorbid substance misuse. Given their high prevalence, substance use disorders should be the focus of treatment programmes in community-sentenced populations. Funding: Wellcome Trust.",[],10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00312-7,1,True
